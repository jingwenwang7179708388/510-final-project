Now, as it celebrates its centenary, staff have been looking back on the company's role in developing a treatment for a rare degenerative condition affecting young boys – a story retold in a Hollywood film. On a housing estate in Hull, two streets honour the story of an American boy who developed a severe brain disease. In 1984, Lorenzo Odone was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and doctors predicted he would not survive childhood. Within a year, children with the condition can become paralysed, blind and unable to speak.

Up to 34,000 properties are thought to have have been affected by an error in a 2020 Scottish law. The emergency bill is designed to avoid a £400m compensation bill for affected property owners - but Conservative MSPs have accused ministers of making an ""unforgivable blunder"". The original law was supposed to allow councils to levy non-domestic rates on empty business properties, but the error meant that they were not actually entitled to do so from April 2023. Non-domestic rates, often called business rates, are set by Holyrood ministers.

Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.

Over the past year, Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, mostly in the east of Ukraine, and have continued their recent barrage of air strikes on Kyiv and other cities. Talks to end the war have been continuing since a US-backed peace plan, which was viewed as being favourable to Russia, was unveiled in November. With Kyiv preparing to present an alternative peace plan to the White House as it seeks to avoid making territorial concessions to Russia, here's a look at the situation on the ground in Ukraine. In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - also known as the Donbas - surrounding and overwhelming villages and towns. It has been trying to gain full control of the area along with two more regions to the west - Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Shortly after the invasion, Russia held referendums to try to annexe all these regions - in the same way it had annexed Crimea in 2014 - but it has never had them under full control.",data/raw/html/6901aee08558a434.html,2025-12-09,2025-12-09,-0.5994,-0.4678,negative,negative,-0.13160000000000005

What it decides at this one will eventually form the basis of China's next Five Year Plan - the blueprint that the world's second largest economy will follow between 2026 and 2030. The full plan won't come until next year, but officials are likely to hint at its contents on Wednesday and have previously given more details within a week of that.

It was sheer political theatre. And it was this meeting - rather than the weaponry - that appears to have irked US President Donald Trump. As the parade began, Trump sent a sharply-worded message on Truth Social, accusing the three leaders of conspiring against America.

Prolonging the war divides Israelis, kills even more Palestinian civilians and horrifies millions around the world, including many who describe themselves as friends of Israel.
