c0l9954yr9ko,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l9954yr9ko,world,One million households without power in Ukraine after Russia attacks energy grid,2025-12-13T12:43:16.896Z,"More than a million households are without electricity in Ukraine after a barrage of overnight Russian strikes hit energy and industrial infrastructure, officials said.
Ukraine's internal affairs minister, Ihor Klymenko, said five regions were hit and at least five people were injured, and work was under way to extinguish fires and restore supplies.
While Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have been common throughout the war, Moscow has intensified strikes as the country heads into winter.
It comes as US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for more talks on ending the war.
Steve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.
On Saturday, Zelensky said more than 450 drones and 30 missiles were used by Russia in overnight strikes. Klymenko said the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Chernihiv regions were hit.
Russia's defence ministry said it used weapons including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes - which are hard to track as they can change direction mid-flight.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all offsite power overnight ""due to widespread military activities affecting the electrical grid"", but is now reconnected.
The plant is in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. It is not operating, but relies on a constant power supply to cool its reactors.
In Russia, regional governor Roman Busargin said two people were killed in Saratov after a drone strike hit a residential building.
The Trump administration is pushing for a deal to end the war to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent.
It has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part.
The Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.
The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.
Zelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a ""special economic zone"".
The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.
""What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?"" said Zelensky.
In public, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have described the US-led talks as fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged.
But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.
In a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week , the US president labelled European leaders ""weak"" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.
Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding.
The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.
On Friday, EU nations agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe.
It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.
That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.
Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder.
Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.
The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.
Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.
Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.

Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an ""Islamist motive"".
Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have ""called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible"". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.
Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people .
Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.
German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.
Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects ""in their decision to commit the crime"".
The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.
Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the ""excellent cooperation between our security services"" had helped to prevent ""a potentially Islamist-motivated attack"".
Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.
Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",287,data/raw/world_c2dz7r708dxo.html
c3r711lnr8zo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r711lnr8zo,world,'It was pandemonium': Jewish community in shock after deadly Bondi Beach attack,2025-12-14T21:56:31.651Z,"The first day of Hanukkah was a sweltering one in Sydney - a perfect afternoon to spend at Australia's most iconic beach.
More than 1,000 people were enjoying a festival marking the occasion at a grassy stretch in Bondi: kids careened around in facepaint, crowds snaked between food trucks, and many enjoyed live entertainment as they soaked up the last rays of sunshine.
Then, just before 7pm local time, shots rang out.
From a small footbridge - just metres from a children's playground - gunmen fired upon the fenced-in crowds. A car full of improvised bombs was parked nearby, though they never went off.
One attendee, who identified himself only as Barry, described watching people around him get shot as hundreds of beach-goers began screaming and running through the park to get away from the attack.
""It was pandemonium and chaos,"" he told the BBC.
One video showed a man - dubbed a ""genuine hero"" by state officials - leaping out from behind a parked car to wrestle a gun from one of the attackers and push him away.
""It was simply an unbelievable scene… in today's day and age, that families and kids on Bondi could be completely mowed down for being Jewish,"" Barry said.
Fifteen people were killed, including a child, according to Australian authorities.
Police say the two gunmen were a father and son: a 50-year-old who has died, and a 24-year-old who is in critical condition. Police are investigating whether a third person helped stage the attack.
This is an unfamiliar, and devastating, shock for Australia - the deadliest shooting in this country since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.
That attack, which killed 35 people, was a turning point, famously prompting the government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun control measures.
We've only had a handful of mass shootings since then, most of them horrific acts of domestic violence - not public attacks like today.
Swiftly declared a terrorist attack by police, it comes amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in Australia since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's subsequent offensive on Gaza.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it an ""act of evil antisemitism"" and a ""vile act of violence and hate"".
But he's been accused by some - including Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - of failing to address the upward trend of antisemitism here.
""The Australian government, which received countless warning signs, must come to its senses!"" Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on X.
Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News Sunday night that the ""worst fears"" of the Jewish community had been realised.
""It's been bubbling under the surface for a long time, and now it's actually happened.""
In a statement, the Australia Jewish Association's Robert Gregory said many Jews would tonight be pondering whether they have a future in Australia.
""To be confronted with this horrific act of antisemitic violence during the Jewish festival of light and hope is shattering. In moments like this, we hold each other close,"" the Jewish Council of Australia said in a statement.
There's a lot police can't - or won't - say yet. But they have declared this was a terrorist attack.
Who the gunmen are - how many of them even - and their motive is still unclear. They said one of the attackers was known to police, but wasn't on their radar for anything like this.
Officials wouldn't answer any questions about those who died either, out of respect for families who are still being notified.
""It's too early to give that information,"" was the most frequent refrain uttered at a press conference late on Sunday night.
But where NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon couldn't offer answers, he tried instead to offer reassurance. Police are throwing everything at this investigation, he said.
He urged the community to remain calm, and avoid spreading misinformation online - including speculating on the victims and perpetrators of the attack.
""I want to make sure that there is no retribution,"" Commissioner Lanyon said.
Local politicians have also asked people not to share graphic footage from the attack on social media.
In the aftermath of the shooting, sirens were ringing through the city and the area surrounding Bondi swarmed with police cars, helicopters circling above.
There we found Fin Green, who was on FaceTime with his family in the UK when he saw the shooting unfolding outside his window. Unsure what was happening, he hid in his wardrobe for an hour and a half, until he felt it was safe to go out.
Danny Clayton, a broadcast journalist who was at the beach and witnessed the events from the Bondi Pavilion, said some people crashed their cars as they attempted to flee.
Many others in the area had similar stories. Restaurant worker William Doliente Petty said he was serving someone when he heard the gunshots. ""The whole shop just stood up and we ran into the back exit.""
Australia prides itself on being a merry, safe country and Bondi Beach has long been a symbol of that. But that image has been shattered and residents are in disbelief.
Sunday's attack also came less than two years after another nearby tragedy. In April last year, a deadly mass stabbing attack took place at nearby Bondi Junction. Shocked, many then uttered the same words we've heard over and over today too: ""This sort of thing just doesn't happen here"".

c4g66nll48do,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g66nll48do,world,Angry fans throw chairs and bottles at Messi event in India,2025-12-13T20:29:18.216Z,"Angry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.
Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.
When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.
West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was ""deeply disturbed and shocked"" by the events.
Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and ""sports lovers"" for the incident at the stadium.
""The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,"" the chief minister said on X.
A spokesperson for Messi said that he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media.
A police official told reporters that the event's ""chief organiser"" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.
Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the ""private event"".
Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi.
His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata , which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.
Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.
They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing ""I love Messi"" headbands.
Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.
The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.
""Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,"" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.
One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.
""I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,"" they said.
""The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.""
Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.
Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.
Kolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.
In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.
In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.
Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.
""For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,"" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.
""Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.""",684,data/raw/world_c4g66nll48do.html
c4gk34k9k23o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk34k9k23o,world,Trump's 'historic' peace deal for DR Congo shattered after rebels seize key city,2025-12-13T16:33:03.206Z,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said Rwanda's actions in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are ""a clear violation of"" the peace deal brokered by Donald Trump last week.
In a post on X, he said the US would ""take action to ensure promises made to the President are kept"", without going into details.
Trump hailed the deal signed with great fanfare in Washington between DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame as ""historic"" and ""a great day for Africa, great day for the world"".
But the M23 rebel group says it has ""fully liberated"" the key city of Uvira in an offensive the US and European powers say is backed by Rwanda . UN experts have previously accused it of having ""de facto control"" of the rebel force's operations.
Rwanda denies the allegations, however, its presence in Washington was a tacit acknowledgment of its influence over the M23.
The rebels were not signatories to Trump's deal - and have been taking part in a parallel peace process led by Qatar, a US ally.
The latest fighting risks further escalating an already deeply complex conflict.
Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist who specialises in the region, told the BBC that the view in M23 circles was that ""they need more leverage in the negotiations"", while the feeling in the Rwandan government is that Tshisekedi cannot be trusted .
He added that the assault on Uvira, in South Kivu province, ""flies in the face of all the negotiations that are under way"".
""It appears to humiliate the US government. I'm not sure what strategic purpose that would serve,"" Prof Stearns told the BBC.
The M23's new offensive in South Kivu started a few days before Kagame and Tshisekedi flew to Washington last week to ratify the agreement first hammered out in June.
Bram Verelst, a Burundi-based researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank, said the assault appeared to be an attempt to force Burundi to withdraw the troops it had in eastern DR Congo backing the army against the rebel forces and Rwanda.
He pointed out that Uvira - which lies just 27km (17 miles) from Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika - was of strategic importance because of the presence of at least 10,000 Burundian troops in South Kivu.
""Uvira is Burundi's gateway into eastern DR Congo, to send troops and supplies. That has now been cut off,"" Mr Verelst told the BBC.
""It seems that many Burundian troops are withdrawing, but it's not clear if all contingents will retreat,"" he added.
Yale Ford, an Africa Analyst for the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that Uvira, which had a population of about 700,000, was the DR Congo government's last major foothold and military hub in South Kivu.
He added that the M23 was now likely to establish a parallel administration in the city , and use its military gains ""as a bargaining chip in peace talks"".
As for the DR Congo government, it has not acknowledged its latest military setback, but says that the ""gravity of the situation is compounded by the now proven risk of regional conflagration"".
Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo for years because of its enmity with Rwanda.
Both accuse the other of backing rebel groups seeking to overthrow their respective governments.
The neighbours share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.
But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.
Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu, it would strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.
Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past.
In an apparent attempt to placate Burundi's fears, the M23 said it had ""no sights beyond our national borders"".
""Our fight has the objective of peace, the protection of the population, the rebuilding of the state in DR Congo, as well as the stability of the Great Lakes region,"" the group added.
Burundi has shut its border with DR Congo, but, according to Mr Verelst, it is still allowing people to cross into its territory after carrying out security checks.
Aid agencies say that about 50,000 people have fled into Burundi in the past week.
Burundian troops - along with the Congolese army and allied militias - fought to block the rebel advance towards Uvira, but the city itself fell ""without much fighting"", Mr Verelst said.
The fall of Uvira would hit Burundi's already struggling economy as the country has been suffering from a severe shortage of foreign currency and fuel, and had been heavily dependent on eastern DR Congo for both, he said.
The M23 began a major advance earlier this year when it captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on the border with Rwanda.
At the time, South African troops were deployed to help DR Congo's army, but they were forced to withdraw after the M23 seized the city in January.
Shortly afterwards the rebels captured the next big city in eastern DR Congo, Bukavu, capital of South Kivu.
The move on Uvira came after the rebels broke the defence lines of the DR Congo army, militias allied with it and Burundian troops.
Prof Stearns said the M23 was estimated to have more than 10,000 fighters, but there was likely to have been an ""influx"" of Rwandan troops for the recent offensive to capture Uvira.
""The reason why they are able to defeat their enemy is that the Rwandan army, at least, is very disciplined, and I think discipline matters more than manpower,"" he said.
""The conflict in recent days has also featured the extensive use of drone technology on both sides but the Rwandans have used this more to their advantage than the Congolese,"" he added.
It appears to be in deep trouble.
The US lays the blame for the recent fighting squarely on Rwanda.
""Instead of progress toward peace, as we have seen under President Trump's leadership in recent weeks, Rwanda is leading the region toward more instability and toward war,"" Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, told a Security Council meeting on Friday.
An earlier statement - issued by the US, European Union, and eight European governments - went further, saying that both the M23 and the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) should immediately halt ""offensive operations"", and Rwandan troops should withdraw from eastern DR Congo.
Prof Stearns said the policy experts he had spoken to were ""baffled"" by the timing of the move to capture Uvira.
""It was literally as they were signing a peace deal in Washington that Rwandan troops were amassing, and then invaded the area around Kamanyola, which is across the border from Rwanda, and then advanced on Uvira,"" he added.
Rwanda's foreign ministry has not responded to the claims that its troops were in South Kivu, but said the ceasefire violations and fighting could not be ""attributed"" to Rwanda.
It accused the DR Congo and Burundian armies of bombing villages near the Rwandan border, and said Burundi had ""amassed"" nearly 20,000 troops in South Kivu in support of DR Congo's army.
It added that it was now clear that DR Congo was ""never ready to commit to peace"", and even though Tshisekedi had attended the ceremony in Washington, it was ""as if he had been forced to sign"" the peace accord.
The DR Congo's government levelled a similar accusation against Kagame, saying he had made a ""deliberate choice""  to abandon the Washington Accord, and to undermine Trump's efforts to end the conflict.
Prof Stearns said the US-led peace process was now on a ""troubled path, perhaps it is stuck"".
He pointed out that the success of the deal hinged on DR Congo's army launching an operation to disarm the FDLR militia group, members of which were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and which Kagame's government sees as a continued threat.
But, Prof Stearns said, he could not see DR Congo's army launching such an operation at the moment.
The peace deal also envisaged economic co-operation between DR Congo and Rwanda, including on hydro-electric power, mining and infrastructure development - something that the US hopes would pave the way for American companies to increase investments in the mineral-rich region.
Prof Stearns said he could not see this happening either while Rwandan troops remained in eastern DR Congo, and fighting continued.
He added that his understanding was that the parallel peace process in Doha - led by Qatar's government to broker a peace deal between the M23 and DR Congo's government - was also on hold at the moment.
""It's very difficult to imagine the Congolese returning there right now after there has been this major offensive by the M23,"" he added.
Prof Stearns said that Tshisekedi was under ""very serious"" pressure from the public for his failure to keep his numerous promises to bring an end to the fighting in the east.
He said Tshisekedi might also be under pressure from parts of the army, with whom he had a strained relationship after the arrest of generals for alleged corruption and because of the setbacks in the east.
He added that Tshisekedi was banking on the US to put pressure on Rwanda to withdraw its support for the M23.
""It's going to be very difficult for the Congolese army to muster a response.
""It's now in the hands of the various peace brokers, the US in particular, and perhaps Qatar and other donors,"" the academic said.
""It's to be seen how much they care about ending this conflict, and how much political capital they are willing to spend.""

c8dyy47qy82o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyy47qy82o,world,'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down,2025-12-14T00:37:15.608Z,"Disaster, catastrophe and nightmare. That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.
Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.
Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).
""David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,"" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. ""Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.""
If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.
Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.
It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.
President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said ""it's imperative that CNN be sold"".
The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic.
Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.
The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount , another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.
When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is ""superior"" to the Netflix deal.
Whether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.
""I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,"" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.
More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims ""greed is good"" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.
Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.
""Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,"" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. ""He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.""
Warner Bros objected to that characterisation.
""Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,"" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC.
For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.
""Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,"" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.
""I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,"" he says.
Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered ""the talkies"" in 1927.
""I think it's a disaster,"" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. ""This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.""
Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.
""At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,"" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.
Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect ""to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.""
Many in Hollywood want to believe them.
John Evans, a sound technician who dabbles in acting, writing and producing, points to Netflix's loving restoration of The Egyptian Theatre along iconic Hollywood Boulevard as a sign of their good faith.
The Egyptian, a classic 1922 theatre, was the site of the world's first movie premiere – Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks – and had fallen into disrepair before Netflix bought the property in 2020 and gave it a $70m makeover.
""I think it's a good sign,"" Mr Evans said, adding that streaming is how many film workers consume movies and TV like the rest of the world.
On the backlot at Warner Bros, tourists snap selfies in front of the Central Perk cafe set from Friends, and stroll by facades of buildings that stand-in for New York or Los Angeles. Inside the offices and writers' rooms, for those still working, it's business as usual.
""I've gone through seven mergers,"" a producer working on the Warner Bros lot said while developing a new show, explaining it's sad to lose a studio because it means it will be even harder to get shows made and sold with one less customer. ""But if you make good stuff, you make good stuff.""
The producer spoke on the condition of anonymity on the day that Paramount Skydance announced their hostile takeover bid. They said they were too busy to worry about the sale because they were trying to get a show on air – and they wouldn't be surprised if another billionaire or trillionaire made another offer for the studio by the end of all this.
""I joke about Elon walking in and doing this, but he could,"" they said of the Tesla and X owner. ""When you have people worth a trillion dollars, there are no rules.""

c8e95gkl5r3o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e95gkl5r3o,world,UK events remember Bondi victims as police step up security in Jewish communities,2025-12-14T20:55:19.955Z,"The victims of a mass shooting during an event marking Hanukkah at Australia's Bondi Beach have been remembered at events around the UK.
Police forces in England and Scotland have said they are increasing their visibility among Jewish communities, as events celebrating the religious holiday get under way.
Fifteen people, including a child, were killed during the Bondi shooting, officials have said, in an attack targeting members of the Jewish community.
A crowd of around 100 people gathered outside the Australian High Commission in central London for a vigil on Sunday evening.
People could be seen waving British and Israeli flags, while some held signs reading: ""Stop the Hate"".
Speaking at the vigil, the rabbi for Marleybone, Yisroel Lew, lit a menorah and said: ""After hearing what happened this morning, the first thought was - how can we bring more light?
""Don't be afraid and celebrate Hanukkah.""
Just down the road in Trafalgar Square, a large menorah was lit up to mark the first day of the festival.
Hundreds of people also attended Hanukkah events in north-west London on Sunday with music and dancing - and an increased police presence.
Present at one of them was Chanie Simon, who went to school with Rabbi Eli Schlanger, among those killed in the Sydney shooting. She described the 41-year-old victim as a ""father in the prime of his life"".
""We are reeling in pain,"" she told the BBC. ""But we are going around and carrying on to make the world a bigger and better place, bringing acts of goodness, acts of light, because that's what the world needs.
""It's awful but we aren't going to let terror stop us.""
The BBC also spoke to Joseph Sassoon who said: ""I'm saddened that Jewish people have to be afraid in this day and age"". He added: ""Years after the Holocaust and Jews are still being murdered.""
London-born Rabbi Eli, a father of five, was described as a ""caring, vivacious, energetic, outgoing guy who loved people"" by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis.
Speaking to the BBC earlier in the day, he said people should ""spread light"" by doing charitable acts in Rabbi Schlanger's name: ""I know how he would have been reacting and it was something he said recently.
""Every human being on earth has a positive way to contribute to making the world a better place, and we just have to keep spreading light.
""The world is a positive place and we need to show that and I know Eli would be saying that.""
Sir Keir Starmer and his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, have lit a menorah in the window of Number 10.
Lady Starmer is Jewish, and Sir Keir has previously said they often mark the beginning of Shabbat on Friday nights.
In a post on social media, the prime minister said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those murdered in the terrorist attack on Bondi Beach today, their loved ones and the whole Jewish community.
""Light will always win over darkness.""
Earlier, the UK's Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) called on the police and government to protect events celebrating Hanukkah - which began on Sunday evening and lasts for eight days - saying: ""We must not let hatred extinguish the festival of light.""
In a statement, the JLC said it is ""devastated and angered that in Sydney, Jews appear to have been targeted once again for being Jewish"".
""We know that such hatred also exists in this country, as we are still reeling from the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur.""
Two people were killed in that attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.
Starmer described the Bondi attack as ""sickening"" and said the government was working with Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish security organisation, on the policing of Hanukkah events in the UK.
Police Scotland said it was carrying out additional patrols around synagogues and other Jewish venues and was ""actively communicating with faith leaders"".
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the Metropolitan Police would increase its visibility in Jewish communities ahead of Hanukkah events.
The police force said: ""At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hanukkah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety.""
It added that ""there is no information to suggest any link between the attack in Sydney and the threat level in London"".
King Charles said he was ""appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack"" at the Bondi Hanukah celebrations, and that his and Queen Camilla's ""hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully"".
He added that the light of the Jewish festival ""will always triumph over the darkness of such evil"".
The Prince and Princess of Wales also issued a statement, saying their ""thoughts are with every Australian today"", and they ""stand with the Jewish community in grief"".
Meanwhile, the UK's chief rabbi said the Jewish community will ""rebuild with tenacity"".
""As we kindle our first Chanukah lights this evening, we hold the victims of the unspeakable atrocity in Sydney in our hearts and in our prayers,"" Sir Ephraim Mirvis  said in a statement on X.
Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he would be attending a Hanukkah event which ""should be a celebration but instead our community is once again mourning"".
""I will be thinking of everyone in Australia and those around the world in the Jewish community who know this fear and loss. We stand with you.""
The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had offered its support to its Australian partners and was in touch with the government to discuss the UK response.
""The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them,"" it added.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has advised any British people caught up in the shooting to contact the Sydney consulate for support.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured in the attack, which targeted a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.
Sixteen people have died after an attack targeting a Hanukkah event on the beach.
Mia Tretta was shot in the 2019 mass shooting at Saugus High School in California.

Officials said three other service members were injured in the attack, during which the gunman was ""engaged and killed"". Syria's state news said two Syrian service personnel were also injured.
US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was ""an ISIS attack"" against the US and Syria and said there would be ""a very serious retaliation"". Syria's president sent condolences to Trump after the attack.
On Sunday Trump said two of the injured American personnel have been released from hospital.
The identities of those killed have yet to be released, with the military saying it is waiting until their next of kin have been informed.
In a post on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said the attack was ""the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman"", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was ""likely"" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.
The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were ""conducting a key leader engagement"", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.
He added the attack is under investigation.
A Pentagon official said: ""This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.""
Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were ""doing well"".
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: ""Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.""
In a post on X, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said the country condemned the attack, and extended its condolences to the families of the victims.
Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: ""I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.
""We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.""
Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a ""new era"" for the two countries.
Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.
The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.
In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled , but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.
The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.
US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.",540,data/raw/world_c9d9vpxjp2go.html
cd0kkyx3vvxo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0kkyx3vvxo,world,Cambodia shuts border crossings with Thailand as fighting continues,2025-12-13T12:48:55.854Z,"Cambodia has shut its border crossings with Thailand, as fighting continues between the two forces on Saturday despite US President Donald Trump earlier saying they had agreed to a ceasefire.
The crossings will be closed until further notice, according to Cambodia's interior ministry.
Earlier, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he told Trump a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia had withdrawn all its forces and removed landmines.
Thai officials said four soldiers were killed on Saturday, as both sides reported continued bombing and artillery exchanges. Cambodia has not been updating its military casualty figure.
Cambodia's defence ministry said that Thai fighter jets bombed hotel buildings and a bridge, while Thailand reported several civilians were injured in a Cambodian rocket attack.
The four deaths on Saturday bring Thailand's total military death toll since Monday to 15, with 270 others injured. It added that six civilians had also been injured.
On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.
At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.
Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.
After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to ""cease shooting effective this evening"" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.
""Both countries are ready for peace,"" he wrote.
But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.
Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. ""They must show us first,"" he said.
The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.
There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.
Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.
On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.
""On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs"" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.
""Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,"" it said.
The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.
The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.
Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks.
After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.
However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.
Since then, tensions continued to build.
This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.
The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.
The recent Washington Accord was hailed as ""historic"" by the US president but the fighting continues.
The lawsuit comes as Donald Trump continues to question his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, despite any reliable evidence.
It comes as the White House welcomes a conservative-led effort to cut the former president's prison sentence.

ce3wkey5p33o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3wkey5p33o,world,'Hero' who wrestled gun from Bondi shooter named as Ahmed al Ahmed,2025-12-14T20:07:58.448Z,"A ""hero"" bystander who was filmed wrestling a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers has been named as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.
Video verified by the BBC showed Mr Ahmed run at the gunman and seize his weapon, before turning the gun round on him, forcing his retreat.
Mr Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two, remains in hospital, where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand, his family told 7News Australia.
Fifteen people died and dozens were injured following the shooting on Sunday night, which took place as more than 1,000 people attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah. The attack has since been declared by police as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.
Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia: ""Still he is in hospital and we don't know exactly what is going on, the doctor says he is OK.
""We hope he is OK, he is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand, he has had to have an operation.""
Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24.
They confirmed that the 50-year-old man died at the scene while the 24-year-old remains in hospital in critical condition.
The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention has been shared widely online.
It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of shot.
Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker, who he tackles.
He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker retreats.
He then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.
Nearby on the bridge, another gunman continues firing. It's unclear who or what he is aiming at.
At a news conference late on Sunday, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns paid tribute to the bravery of Mr Ahmed, who was unnamed at the time.
""That man is a genuine hero, and I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.""
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: ""We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.
""These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.""",420,data/raw/world_ce3wkey5p33o.html
cj38rj0y6k5o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj38rj0y6k5o,world,He was an Uber driver in the US. Now he's scared of jihadists after deportation to Somalia,2025-12-14T01:05:53.036Z,"Mahad Mohamud is slowly readjusting to the heat, chaos and tension of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after being deported from the US city of Minneapolis last month just as winter was closing in there.
Somalis know the 36-year-old as Garyaqaan - a word that can be translated as ""judge"".
This is the name he uses on TikTok, where he attracted almost half a million followers while he was abroad. Fans praised Mahad for his defence of his clan's interests - part of Somalia's lucrative TikTok roasting sub-culture .
But to those running the White House-linked ""Rapid Response 47"" X account, Mahad was a ""criminal illegal scumbag"". In an October post it accused him of being ""involved in the kidnapping of French officials"" from a hotel in the Somali capital.
Mahad has denied the allegation, saying that he was not in Mogadishu at the time. He was never convicted and the case was dropped.
He says his detention by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency was triggered after a rival TikToker leaked his address.
""ICE told me they had two cases against me - one was entering the country illegally and the kidnapping of a French official.""
Mahad said the kidnapping case was handled by the FBI and after questioning, they cleared him.
But that didn't save him from being deported.
His journey from Somalia to the US started more than a decade ago and first took him to South Africa, where he lived until 2021. But he says he was assaulted by armed men in a xenophobic attack.
He then went to Brazil and made his way north, eventually crossing into the US, without documentation, through the Mexican border.
""When I jumped the fence from Mexico, I was arrested and detained for a month,"" Mahad says.
""I was later released with a work permit because my asylum case was active.""
He then made his way to Minneapolis. ""I used to work as an Uber driver. I was happy to finally be in the land of dreams. I hoped they would accept me.""
His TikTok career also took off which gave him a steady income as fans sent him gifts as they watched his live streams. It also led to a threat on his life from the Somalia-based Islamist militant group al-Shabab because of his defence of the government.
Part of his asylum case in the US was based on that threat.
Mahad describes in vivid detail the early May morning when immigration agents arrested him this year.
Shortly after he had eaten breakfast, he went to his car thinking he was about to begin another day of Uber driving.
""Boom, they came for me,"" he says.
According to Mahad, he was taken on a 30-minute drive to the ICE headquarters serving Minneapolis and its twin city of St Paul, before being transferred on a six-hour journey to Kandiyohi County Jail Prison in Willmar, Minnesota, where he says he spent six months in detention.
He tells the BBC that three of those months were spent waiting for a decision on his asylum case, and the remaining three awaiting deportation. The authorities denied his asylum claim as they rejected the idea that he would be in danger in Somalia.
Mahad says there were brief periods when he was transferred to Arizona, from where deportation fights leave, but he was told on each occasion that logistical arrangements were not ready.
On one of these trips, he was part of a group of 39 detainees, including nationals of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, in a holding area for people waiting to board deportation flights.
Finally, when it came to his own departure, Mahad says he was put in a tight restraining jacket and travelled on a small plane with seven other deportees and some guards.
The journey first took them to Costa Rica, in Central America, then to Senegal in West Africa, before flying to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. There Mahad says the restraining jacket was removed and he was handcuffed and put on another plane to Mogadishu.
Having spent three months waiting to be deported, Mahad had already resigned himself to his fate and was not particularly emotional on his return.
After a decade apart, he has finally been reunited with his three children. ""I wouldn't trade this moment for anything now... I haven't seen them for 10 years,"" Mahad says.
But he would still prefer to be in the US because he fears for his life after receiving text messages from al-Shabab, containing death threats.
He takes extra security precautions when he's out and lives in a well protected home but did not want to go into further details, or share the contents of the threats, for safety reasons.
On his return, Mahad was welcomed by many people from his clan, including local politicians, because of his TikTok profile. He understands that because of his social media presence he may get opportunities not available to other Somalis deported - or threatened with deportation - from the US.
Last month, President Donald Trump said he would end the temporary protection status that is supposed to prevent people from being deported while their home country is unsafe.
Earlier this month, he upped the ante, saying that he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, telling reporters they should ""go back to where they came from"" and ""their country is no good for a reason"".
Somalia has not had a central government in control of the whole country since the toppling of President Siad Barre in 1991. People have had to endure years of near anarchy and insecurity - and even now, despite a government being in place in Mogadishu, Islamist militants still dominate much of the country and occasionally stage attacks in the capital.
Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in the state of Minnesota's social assistance programme.
Dozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the state's government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic.
A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme.
In the wake of the president's remarks about Somalis, videos have circulated on social media appearing to show immigration agents knocking on doors across Minneapolis, which includes an area known as Little Mogadishu, and St Paul.
For many in the city's Somali community, the largest in the US and numbering around 80,000, the posts have triggered alarm.
The BBC also spoke to five young Somali men who now spend their days confined to a friend's small house, moving carefully through rooms that are not their own. They left their rented apartment abruptly last week not because they wanted to, but because the lease was under their names.
As people who had been given temporary protected status, they feared it was only a matter of time before ICE traced the address and came for them. They grabbed what they could carry and slipped away in the night, hoping the change of location would offer some protection.
Now, their lives are suspended. Work shifts are missed. Meals are skipped or stretched. One of the men described how quickly everything has collapsed: ""We're running out of food. We haven't reported to work for the past five days because we're scared that ICE might be waiting for us. I don't know what will happen to us.""
Mahad is far from being alone in being deported to Somalia in recent months, although there are no official figures.
The BBC also spoke to another young Somali man, who asked to remain anonymous. He said he was struggling to rebuild his life back in Mogadishu.
From rural Somalia, he was desperate to leave as a prolonged drought had destroyed his livelihood. He illegally crossed into the US through the Mexican border after travelling north from Brazil but was detained shortly after. He spent 18 months in custody before being returned to Somalia.
Speaking on the phone, he describes feeling uncertain about his future.
""They sent me back to start from zero,"" he says. ""Everything I worked for just disappeared.""
He says he spent around $20,000 (£15,000) to reach the US, including money he had borrowed from friends and family.
Since returning home, he has had no money and says there are no opportunities in Somalia.
""I don't see a future here,"" he says. ""There is nothing going on… no employment.""
He is now considering migrating once more.
""I don't want to start life again. I just want to migrate to any country now.""

ckg9l1j9wxno,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9l1j9wxno,world,What we know so far about the Brown University shooting,2025-12-14T18:41:55.881Z,"Police have detained a person of interest in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead and nine others injured.
An earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter in place has also been lifted.
The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website Gun Violence Archive .
It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.
Here's what we know:
The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Barus and Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.
Final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting, the school said.
The engineering building is a seven-storey block that includes 117 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and three lecture halls.
An economics professor told local public media outlet Ocean State Radio that the shooting had taken place during a review session for her course, which was led by her teaching assistant.
""He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something - he couldn't remember what he yelled - and started shooting,"" Rachel Friedberg said.
""Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot,"" she added.
On Saturday, investigators said they were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom.
Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Mayor of Providence Brett Smiley said.
Two students, who were studying in the nearby Rockefeller library when the active gunman alert came through, told the BBC they ""stayed away from the windows"" as they awaited a police escort.
Officers searched the floor, made them drop their bags and raise their hands before before being led out of the library, the pair said.
Brown University, one of the oldest higher education institutions in the US, is part of the Ivy League, a group of elite universities in the northeast of the country.
The university, which has more than 11,000 students, is in Providence, Rhode Island's capital city, which is located about 50 miles (80km) from Boston and 180 miles (290km) from New York City.
Two students were killed in the incident and nine others were injured.
Smiley told reporters on Sunday that one person is in a critical condition and seven others are in a stable condition in hospital. One person with less severe injuries was discharged, he added.
The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.
""This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us,"" she said in a statement.
In a statement on Sunday, the university said that the families of the two students killed were being supported.
""There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,"" Ms Paxson said.
According to police, a ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, but had non-life threatening injuries from fragments from a shooting ""that had occurred near them"".
A person of interest was taken into custody in connection with the shooting, officials said on Sunday.
Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said limited details would be released on the detained suspect, but said he was in his 20s.
In a post on X, FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.
A law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the person of interest is not currently enrolled as a student at Brown University.
Officials confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else.
On Saturday police released CCTV footage of a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.
There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered. Officials also say a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building on Saturday.
Some witnesses reportedly told officers he may have been wearing a camouflage grey mask.
One person was arrested before police determined they were not involved in the shooting and released them.
In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Ms Paxson said some areas of campus are still restricted as police continue their investigations.
She said around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, adding that she was ""deeply moved"" by students and locals who opened up their homes.
Brown University said all remaining exams, papers and projects would not take place as scheduled.
US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House from attending the annual Army and Navy football game, described the shooting as ""a terrible thing"".
""All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,"" he said.

Nine others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.
Police said the detained suspect was in his 20s, but have not named him.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said seven people who were injured in the incident remained in a stable condition, one of them is in critical condition, and another was discharged.
The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.
The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters on Saturday that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.
In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Paxson said some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations.
Around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, she said, adding that she was ""deeply moved"" by students and locals who opened up their homes.
Paxson said the families of the two students killed were being supported.
""There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,"" she added.
In a news conference on Sunday, Smiley said an earlier order for residents to shelter had now been lifted.
The mayor said he had met with victims and their families in the hospital and was ""overwhelmed"" by their ""courage, hope, and gratitude"".
A vigil will be held on Sunday evening for the community.
Police had earlier released CCTV footage of a male suspect walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing. Officers said a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building.
In a post on X,  FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry, in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.
Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else and were working with prosecutors to collect evidence.
Hundreds of police officers and federal agents were sent to Providence on Saturday to find the suspect.
Speaking at the White House, President Trump said he hoped the nine injured students ""get well fast"" and paid respects to the families of the two people who died.
The attack on the Ivy League university brings the number of mass shootings to 389 in the US for this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.
At least 15 people have been killed and at least a further 42 injured in a shooting during Hanukkah celebrations.

Fifteen people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed in the attack, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called ""an act of antisemitism... [and] terrorism on our shores"".
The older gunman, 50, died after being shot dead by police. The 24-year-old is in a critical condition.
Mass shootings in Australia are very rare, and the attack at Bondi is the deadliest incident in the country since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 when 35 people were killed by a lone gunman.
Police have declared the incident a terrorist attack.
Here's what we know so far.
At around 18:47 local time (07:47 GMT), New South Wales Police received reports that a number of shots had been fired at Archer Park, Bondi Beach.
A short while later, police shared their first public statement, urging anyone at the scene to take shelter and others to avoid the area.
Verified videos captured hundreds of people fleeing the beach, screaming and running as a volley of gunshots rang out.
Footage verified by the BBC appears to show two gunmen firing from a small bridge which crosses from the car park on Campbell Parade towards Bondi Beach.
Separate video verified by the BBC shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, before taking his gun and turning it back on him. The gunman then retreats towards the bridge, from where another attacker is firing.
The bystander has since been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two.
His family told 7News Australia he remains in hospital where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand.
He was described by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns as a ""genuine hero"".
""I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery,"" Minns told a news conference.
In the same footage, another man - who appears to be injured -  is seen fleeing the scene, as police arrive and begin to fire in the direction of the gunmen.
A further verified video shows several police officers on the same bridge. One appears to be administering CPR to a motionless man as someone shouts ""he's dead, he's dead"".
A 10-year-old girl was among the fifteen people killed the shooting, according to New South Wales Police.
The ages of the victims ranges from 10 to 87 years old. No further details have been provided.
The family of British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, has told the BBC that he is among the dead.
Schlanger's cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, said he was ""vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people"".
Israeli media - citing Israel's foreign ministry - reported that an Israeli citizen was also killed.
French citizen Dan Elkayam has also been identified as a victim of the attack.
In a tribute shared to X, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said he mourned with Mr Elkayam's family and loved ones, the Jewish community and bereaved Australians.
The 50-year-old gunman was shot dead by police, while the younger guman remains in hospital in a critical condition.
A further 42 people are in hospital, police say.
New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told ABC News on Monday that some are ""critically injured, some seriously injured"".
Park also said four children were transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital. It is not clear if the child who died is included in this number.
Two police officers were shot and injured during the incident, according to police. They were reported on Sunday to be in a ""serious, verging on critical"" condition.
Police say the gunmen were father and son aged 50 and 24, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference on Monday morning.
The 50-year-old male was a licenced firearms holder. He was linked to six firearms, all of which were believed to have been used in the Bondi Beach attack, Lanyon said.
Police have declared Sunday's shooting a terror attack.
Overnight on Sunday into Monday, an exclusion zone was set up around the scene as police use specialist equipment to check improvised explosive devices (IEDs) found in a car linked to one of the gunmen, and police are still urging the public to avoid the area.
During a televised address, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the shooting ""an act of evil antisemitism"".
""We have seen Australians today run towards dangers in order to help others. These Australians are heroes and their bravery has saved lives,"" he added.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog has called the shooting a ""very cruel attack on Jews"", while King Charles - who is head of state in the Commonwealth nation - said he was ""appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack"".
Hanukkah, or Chanukah in Hebrew, is often referred to as the Jewish festival of lights.
The dates of Hanukkah change every year, but it will always fall in November or December and lasts for eight days.
An event to mark the first day of the celebration was taking place on Bondi Beach at the time of the shooting.
A digital flyer for the event, named Chanuka by the Sea 2025 , shows it was scheduled to take place near the beach's children's playground from 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Sunday.
Organised by Jewish centre Chabad of Bondi, the event was set to feature live entertainment and activities ""for all ages"". Around 1,000 people were said to be in attendance.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured in the attack, which targeted a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.
At least 15 people have been killed and at least a further 42 injured in a shooting during Hanukkah celebrations.
Aerial footage appears to show a gunman firing from a bridge in a nearby carpark.
Eleven people were killed in the shooting at Australia's Bondi Beach, as crowds attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah.

crk777lj763o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk777lj763o,world,"New photos from Epstein estate show Trump, Andrew and Bill Clinton",2025-12-13T02:16:51.877Z,"Democratic US lawmakers have released two new batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing details of the convicted paedophile's home and ties to the rich and powerful.
US President Donald Trump, former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon are among the high-profile figures featured in the photos. The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.
The nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.
The justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.
In the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.
Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.
A third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.
An additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: ""Trump Condom"".
The White House called the release a ""Democrat hoax"" against Trump that has been ""repeatedly debunked"". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.
Friday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.
One photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.
Two other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.
Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he ""knows nothing about the terrible crimes"" Epstein pleaded guilty to.
One image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.
The image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.
Andrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his ""prince"" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.
A third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.
Other prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.
No additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.
There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: ""Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.""
Republicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of ""cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump"".
In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: ""It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.""
""These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,"" he added.
Epstein's connection to multiple high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and demands for greater transparency around the investigations into the billionaire financier.
Following months of pressure from across the political spectrum, the justice department has until 19 December to release all documents related to the Epstein case as required by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by Trump in November.
That upcoming deadline is separate from the congressional investigation into the Epstein case.
Friday's publications mark the second time in a month that Democrats on the committee have published new images from its inquiry into Epstein.
They originally released 19 images on Friday morning before publishing another nearly 80 later in the day, saying in a statement: ""In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate.""
Trump was asked about the new photos on Friday evening and told reporters that a lot of people knew and were photographed with Epstein, calling the release ""no big deal"".
Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, but according to the president, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also previously said that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for ""being a creep"".

crrknvqn97no,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrknvqn97no,world,'Everyone says it'll never be me' - Brown University student on surviving two mass shootings,2025-12-14T21:13:22.482Z,"With the holiday break just around the corner, 21-year-old Mia Tretta was in her dorm with a friend studying for their final exams.
Just like other students at Brown University, she was distraught after receiving an active shooter alert from the university's department of public safety.
But the difference for her is she has lived through this once before.
Mia was shot in the 2019 mass shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California.
She told the BBC it shattered her sense of safety and innocence.
""Everyone always tells themselves it'll never be me,"" she said.
A 16-year-old boy shot her in the stomach and four others; two of them died including her best friend.
A junior in high school at the time, Mia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering.
She still has bullet fragments in her stomach, and has had multiple surgeries for nerve pain and to fix a hole in her eardrum.
Attending Brown University, on the other side of the country, in Rhode Island, was meant to get her far away from what happened, in order to feel safe again.
She told herself at least it wouldn't happen again, until it did.
""Gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot before, and it doesn't care what community you're in,"" she said.
""It's an epidemic that touches every single community.""
Mia now feels a mixture of fear, confusion and anger. Americans, she says, shouldn't accept mass shootings as a fact of life.
Her generation has grown up practising active shooter drills in schools, and she is not the only student at Brown University who has now lived through their second school shooting.
At a press conference on Sunday, the mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, was asked what could be done to stop the ""uniquely American experience"" of mass shootings on campuses.
He was reluctant to weigh in with the investigation ongoing and the victims still recovering, but he shared a conversation he had had with one of the injured students.
""When I was at the hospital today - one of students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, 'you know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school it actually helped me in the moment',"" he said.
""Which at the same time provided me hope, and was so sad. They shouldn't have to do active shooter drills but it helped, and the reason it helped and the reason we do these drills is because it's so damn frequent.""
Driving around campus, there is still a heavy police presence even though the lockdown has been lifted.
One student, who was leaving for the holidays, said: ""Our perfect bubble, that we've been in for so long, just shattered.""
At least 15 people have been killed and at least a further 42 injured in a shooting during Hanukkah celebrations.
Aerial footage appears to show a gunman firing from a bridge in a nearby carpark.

cvg1r89m6g7o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1r89m6g7o,world,'Never give up': Belarusian prisoners celebrate release after US lifts sanctions,2025-12-14T18:18:37.465Z,"Rumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.
But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.
In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.
Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.
A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.
""It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free,"" Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.
The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.
""But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free.""
Out too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.
The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.
All were imprisoned for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced.
The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.
For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.
But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.
It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.
The dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.
Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.
Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. ""I've just spoken to Masha,"" she told me after a video call.
A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.
""She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,"" her sister said.
Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.
But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.
The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.
Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.
""Lukashenko's idea, who else?"" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.
But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.
So has the US gone too far, I wondered.
""This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.
""But this is how negotiation goes,"" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.
""President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.""
A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.
After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.
Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.
""I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,"" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.
When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: ""I want to see my wife!""
She's on her way, I was told.
Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.
""It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.""
Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.
""Optimism and activism,"" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. ""Never give up!""
Julia Fenner was given a long jail term after being detained while entering Belarus in March 2024.
After his unexpected release, Sergei Tikhanovsky broke down describing his five years in solitary confinement
Sergei Tikhanovsky had planned to challenge Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 election, but was detained before the vote.
Some receive threatening messages or phone-calls, others say their relatives are visited by authorities back home.

In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had ""eliminated"" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.
Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City.
The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.
A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.
The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident.
The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been ""responsible for the deaths of many soldiers"" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.
Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October.
Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.
One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.
He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.
Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.
Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.
The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.
About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.
All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.
Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.
The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.
It envisages Gaza being run by the ""temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,"" overseen by a ""Board of Peace"" chaired by Trump.
Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.
The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which ""the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood"".
Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.
Ghana says its citizens were subjected to ""humiliating treatment"" in Israel, which has not commented.
He fails to carry out due diligence over the funding links of a parliamentary group's secretariat.
Hayat says her teenage daughter cannot leave Gaza and take up her UK scholarship due to her age.
Benjamin Netanyahu expects to move to the second phase ""very shortly"", as a Hamas official suggests it is ready to consider ""freezing or storing"" its weapons.

cx2dp15zglxo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dp15zglxo,world,The making of a WWE legend: John Cena faces his final fight,2025-12-13T00:05:31.381Z,"The Last Time Is Now. It's the name of the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to take on John Cena in his final fight before retirement.
And that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.
In the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic ""You Can't See Me"" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.
If you were to pose the question ""who is John Cena?"", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).
How to watch John Cena's last match:
Since his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from ""ruthless aggression"" rookie, to a ""Doctor of Thuganomics"" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a ""Never Give Up"" attitude.
Despite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of ""you can't wrestle"" through the years, ""there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent"", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.
He feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became ""increasingly scripted in a way it had not been"" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed to thrive.
""He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,"" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.
""There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.""
Outside the ring too, he's a personality who ""people gravitate towards and want to listen to"", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.
""To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,"" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.
""I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.""
For Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's ""his charisma"".
""He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,"" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's ""always maintained a good guy persona"".
""No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,"" she says.
It also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.
With The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.
Mr Thurston feels WWE leadership recognised Cena ""would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot"".
It's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.
While he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.
And when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a ""decline"" in the WWE product.
Other wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch , saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.
Having achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could ""just come in and be a wrestler and walk out"", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.
Among the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.
He also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by ""accident"", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as ""the coolest thing"".
""If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,"" Dr Brooks says. ""The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.
""It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.""
Both Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.
Explaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.
His career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his ""body hurts"" and is ""screaming to close the chapter"".
While the old saying ""never say never"" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be ""100% done"" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.
Overall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's ""retirement run"", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.
He does feel the ""execution"" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term ""heel turn"" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.
""It could have been handled better,"" Joe says. ""[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.
""It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.""
Not that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.
Having won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will be Cena's one opponent in his final fight.
With it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.
One thing's for sure: ""You Can't See Me"" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.
Co-star Josh Hutcherson is also set to resume his role as Peeta in prequel Sunrise on the Reaping.
The actor was not entertained by how they changed the storyline of his character in the sequel.
Trump became chairman of the institution this year and is the first president to host the ceremony recognising artists for lifetime achievement.
The planned deal would cement Netflix in its position as the world's biggest subscription streaming service.

c0r959n91p4o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r959n91p4o,business,The Swiss city that lets you pay for most things with bitcoin,2025-12-11T00:22:58.425Z,"In a McDonald's by a lake surrounded by mountains, in the centre of the Swiss city of Lugano, a customer orders coffee.
""Can I pay with bitcoin?"" he asks, and the person behind the counter holds out what looks like a credit card payment terminal.
It is in fact a machine for paying by crypto currency. The equipment has been distributed free to local retail businesses by the city council.
The buyer pays by contactless, from the bitcoin wallet on his mobile phone. The bill comes to 0.00008629, which is roughly $8.80 (£6.60).
Few people who have bought bitcoin would probably think about using it to purchase actual things in shops. It is instead generally seen as an investment, a bet on its value going up.
But in Lugano, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, it's a different story.
While you can of course still pay for everything in Swiss francs, some 350 shops and restaurants now also accept bitcoin. The local authority has even started taking payments in crypto currency for municipal services. You can, for example, pay for pre-school childcare in bitcoin.
I get talking to the McDonald's customer, Nicolas, who comes from France. He is what you might call a bitcoin true believer.
""What's great about paying in bitcoin is the feeling of freedom it gives you,"" he says. ""You are no longer dependant on a financial system with its middlemen and its costs.""
Nicolas says he's discovered bitcoin cards in Switzerland. These are prepaid gift cards. You buy a certain sum in Swiss francs but download it in bitcoin onto a digital wallet on your phone.
I walk through the centre of Lugano, down a high street where just about all the shops sell luxury stuff. Jewellery or expensive clothes mainly.
In a shop called Vintage Nassa that sells new and second-hand bags and watches, the owner Cherubino Fry tells me he accepts bitcoin because the processing fee he has to pay per transaction is less than those charged by credit card companies.
For bitcoin it is generally below 1%, while for debit cards it can be as high as 1.7%, and up to 3.4% for credit cards. Although for the latter two it can vary from country to country.
I ask Mr Fry if he does much business in bitcoin.
""In reality, not a lot. For now, only sporadically, only some clients,"" he says. ""But using bitcoin will be like a tree growing, and this tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.""
A stone's throw from Mr Fry's shop, I visit the headquarters of Plan B, an initiative launched in 2022 by the City of Lugano in collaboration with crypto currency platform Tether.
With the B standing for bitcoin, its stated aim is to educate people about cryptocurrency, and ""to make Lugano the European hub for bitcoin"".
""I want to talk about an experiment I did this July,"" says Plan B hub director Mir Liponi. She explains that she had a problem with her bank, which resulted in her not being able to access her funds.
For 11 days she had no way of paying, other than with bitcoin, but she says that experiment turned out well, and that you can mostly survive just on bitcoin in Lugano.
""It's missing public transportation at the moment… another one is fuel. Groceries are okay. I got things delivered at home, even.
""Plenty of medical places, but not a dentist. And another big thing is [energy] bills. You cannot pay bills in bitcoin yet.""
Ms Liponi adds that in the future she wants to see ""circular economies where people earn bitcoin, keep bitcoin, spend bitcoin, pay for services in bitcoin"".
Yet elsewhere, similar bitcoin projects to Lugano's have come unstuck.
In 2021, El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar. To encourage its use the government gave people the bitcoin equivalent of $30 that they downloaded via an app.
""So what people did was download the app, exchange the bitcoin for dollars and never use it again,"" says Vincent Charles, head of crypto currency firm Unchain Data.
He went to El Salvador earlier this year to see how bitcoin uptake was going, and concluded that people don't really use it, and retailers and service providers rarely accept it.
However, there are other successful bitcoin adoption examples from around the globe. Slovenian capital Ljubljana was declared the world's most crypto-friendly city in a report back in April, followed by Hong Kong and Zurich.
Back in Lugano, not everyone is seemingly impressed with bitcoin. In a park on the lakefront there used to be a statue representing Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the unknown person or persons who claim to have invented the crypto currency back in 2008.
In August, vandals broke the sculpture into bits and threw it into Lake Lugano.
""It's interesting because not that many things get vandalised around here,"" says Lucia, a passerby who lives in the city. ""People are usually fairly well behaved. And you don't see often people having very strong political opinions either.""
She adds, though, that she herself is skeptical of cryptocurrencies in general.
""At the University of Lugano where I study there's a club to promote bitcoin and everything. I do find it surprising that institutions such as my university would promote cryptocurrencies so much. I think they are associated with crime, with the dark web and speculation.
""A lot of people lose their money because they invest in a cryptocurrency and then it crashes.""
Sergio Rossi is a professor of economics at Switzerland's University of Fribourg. He says that bitcoin is a risk for shopkeepers in Lugano or elsewhere because of its volatility – its value can go sharply up and down.
So, he says it is important that they instantly convert the bitcoin they receive into Swiss francs, euros, or another currency issued by a government or central bank. These are also known as ""fiat"" currencies.
He adds: ""There is also a reputational risk with those cryptocurrencies used in illegal transactions, which could affect the city of Lugano and its financial institutions.""
Prof Rossi also cautions that people's bitcoin is held by a digital third party, which makes it risky. ""If the platform where my digital wallet is recorded fails or goes bankrupt, my cryptocurrencies disappear instantaneously.
""And therefore, I lose the corresponding amount forever. By contrast, in Switzerland, all bank deposits are guaranteed up to the amount of 100,000 Swiss francs ($125,000; £94,000). This means that if the bank where my savings are recorded goes bankrupt, I can recover them up to this amount.""
At Lugano town hall I ask Mayor Michele Foletti if he is concerned that Lugano could be a magnet for mafia money.
""No. You can use fiat money to do something good or something bad,"" he says. ""The same with bitcoin.
""And mafia people are more interested to use fiat for money laundering. When they sell drugs or something like this, they receive [physical] fiat money, not bitcoin because the more anonymous way is cash,"" he says.
He adds that bitcoin continues to be positive for Lugano, and that 110 crypto-sector companies have now moved to, or started up, in the city.

Just a handful of companies can make cadmium zinc telluride, a material with powerful properties.
The levies are set to take effect on 1 January and will apply to goods like cars, clothing and appliances.",1286,data/raw/business_c0r959n91p4o.html
c24l223d9n7o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24l223d9n7o,business,'It's amazing' – the wonder material very few can make,2025-12-12T00:03:10.043Z,"Lying on your back in a big hospital scanner, as still as you can, with your arms above your head – for 45 minutes. It doesn't sound much fun.
That's what patients at Royal Brompton Hospital in London had to do during certain lung scans, until the hospital installed a new device last year that cut these examinations down to just 15 minutes.
It is partly thanks to image processing technology in the scanner but also a special material called cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), which allows the machine to produce highly detailed, 3D images of patients' lungs.
""You get beautiful pictures from this scanner,"" says Dr Kshama Wechalekar, head of nuclear medicine and PET. ""It's an amazing feat of engineering and physics.""
The CZT in the machine, which was installed at the hospital last August, was made by Kromek – a British company. Kromek is one of just a few firms in the world that can make CZT. You may never have heard of the stuff but, in Dr Wechalekar's words, it is enabling a ""revolution"" in medical imaging.
This wonder material has many other uses, such as in X-ray telescopes, radiation detectors and airport security scanners. And it is increasingly sought-after.
Investigations of patients' lungs performed by Dr Wechalekar and her colleagues involve looking for the presence of many tiny blood clots in people with long Covid, or a larger clot known as a pulmonary embolism, for example.
The £1m scanner works by detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive substance that is injected into patients' bodies.
But the scanner's sensitivity means less of this substance is needed than before: ""We can reduce doses about 30%,"" says Dr Wechalekar. While CZT-based scanners are not new in general, large, whole-body scanners such as this one are a relatively recent innovation.
CZT itself has been around for decades but it is notoriously difficult to manufacture. ""It has taken a long time for it to develop into an industrial-scale production process,"" says Arnab Basu, founding chief executive of Kromek.
In the company's facility at Sedgefield, there are 170 small furnaces in a room that Dr Basu describes as looking ""like a server farm"".
A special powder is heated up in these furnaces, turned molten, and then solidified into a single-crystal structure. The whole process takes weeks. ""Atom by atom, the crystals are rearranged […] so they become all aligned,"" says Dr Basu.
The newly formed CZT, a semiconductor, can detect tiny photon particles in X-rays and gamma rays with incredible precision – like a highly specialised version of the light-sensing, silicon-based image sensor in your smartphone camera.
Whenever a high energy photon strikes the CZT, it mobilises an electron and this electrical signal can be used to make an image. Earlier scanner technology used a two-step process, which was not as precise.
""It's digital,"" says Dr Basu. ""It's a single conversion step. It retains all the important information such as timing, the energy of the X-ray that is hitting the CZT detector – you can create colour, or spectroscopic images.""
He adds that CZT-based scanners are currently in use for explosives detection at UK airports, and for scanning checked baggage in some US airports. ""We expect CZT to come into the hand luggage segment over the next [few] years.""
But it's not always easy to get your hands on CZT.
Henric Krawczynski at Washington University in St Louis in the US has used the material before on space telescopes attached to high altitude balloons. These detectors can pick up X-rays emitted by both neutron stars and plasma around black holes.
Prof Krawczynski wants very thin, 0.8mm pieces of CZT for his telescopes because this helps to reduce the amount of background radiation they pick up, allowing for a clearer signal. ""We'd like to buy 17 new detectors,"" he says. ""It's really difficult to get these thin ones.""
He was unable to source the CZT from Kromek. Dr Basu says his firm has high demand at the moment. ""We support many, many research organisations,"" he adds, ""It's very difficult for us to do a hundred different things. Each research [project] needs a very particular type of detector structure.""
For Prof Krawczynski, it's not a crisis – he says he might use either CZT that he has from previous research, or cadmium telluride, an alternative, for his next mission.
However, there are bigger headaches at the moment. That upcoming mission was due to fly from Antarctica in December but ""all the dates are in flux"", says Prof Krawczynski, because of the US government shutdown .
Many other scientists use CZT. In the UK, a major upgrade of the Diamond Light Source research facility in Oxfordshire – costing half a billion pounds – will improve its capabilities thanks to the installation of CZT-based detectors.
Diamond Light Source is a synchrotron, which fires electrons around a giant ring at nearly the speed of light. Magnets cause these whizzing electrons to lose some energy in the form of X-rays, and these are directed off from the ring in beamlines so that they may be used to analyse materials, for example.
Some recent experiments have involved probing impurities in aluminium while it melts. Understanding those impurities better could help improve recycled forms of the metal.
With Diamond Light Source's upgrade, due to complete in 2030, the X-rays produced will be significantly brighter, meaning that existing sensors would not be able to detect them properly.
""There's no point in spending all this money in upgrading these facilities if you can't detect the light they produce,"" says Matt Veale, group leader for detector development at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a stakeholder in the Diamond Light Source.
That's why, here too, CZT is the material of choice.

The measures, which President Claudia Sheinbaum has said are needed to boost domestic production, were passed by the Mexican Senate on Wednesday.
The levies are set to take effect on 1 January 2026 and will apply to goods like metals, cars, clothing and appliances. Dozens of countries that do not have a free trade agreement with Mexico will be affected, including Thailand, India and Indonesia.
The move comes as Mexico is in negotiations with the US over steep import taxes that President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on the country.
The measures will impose tariffs of up to 50% on more than 1,400 products.
The levies will ""substantially harm the interests of trading partners, including China,"" said a spokesperson for Beijing's commerce ministry on Thursday.
An investigation into Mexico's trade policy is in progress, they added, urging the country to ""correct"" its decision.
This week, China also signalled its plans for more involvement with Latin American and Caribbean countries, as it aims to deepen its relationships in the region through trade and innovation.
Chinese companies have been expanding their footprint in Mexico in recent years, with car brands like BYD and MG establishing operations in the country.
But Washington has said Beijing may be using Mexico as a way to bypass US tariffs.
The BBC has contacted the embassies in Mexico of Thailand, India and Indonesia for comment.
Sheinbaum's government is in talks with the Trump administration as it tries to reduce tariffs on the country. They include 50% duties on Mexican steel and aluminium.
Trump has also threatened to impose extra tariffs on Mexico for various reasons, including a 25% levy as part of Washington's measures to pressure countries to do more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into America.
On Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water.
""It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,"" he posted on social media.
Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries.
For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement.

The firm said in November it was testing the ""first-of-its-kind"" tool in the US to help viewers catch up on some of its shows on streaming service Prime Video - including Fallout, its adaptation of the popular video game franchise.
But it has since disappeared from the site after users highlighted mistakes in its video summarising the events of Fallout season one - including claiming one scene was set more than 100 years earlier than it was.
The BBC has approached Amazon for comment.
The move to apparently press pause on its AI-powered recaps was first reported by tech publication The Verge .
Amazon said in November the recaps would be available to users as an experimental feature, and only ""for select English-language Prime Original series in the US"".
""Video Recaps use AI to summarise a show's most pertinent plot points with a theatrical-quality video that includes narration, dialogue, and music,"" it said .
But fans eagerly awaiting the release of the next series of Fallout on 17 December highlighted errors introduced in its video recap for its first series.
Users on Reddit said a clip showing The Ghoul - one of the show's central characters, played by actor Walton Goggins - was wrongly described in the AI narration as a ""1950s flashback"".
Despite the clip's retro aesthetic, it actually depicts a scene in 2077 - something fans of the series would know instantly.
Fans also said the recap incorrectly summarised a scene between The Ghoul and protagonist Lucy MacLean, played by Ella Purnell, altering their dynamic in a way that would confuse new viewers.
It joins a long list of errors have being introduced when using generative AI tools to produce content summaries.
In early 2025, Apple suspended an AI feature summarising notifications after it drew complaints for repeated mistakes in its summaries of news headlines.
The BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature , after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers Luigi Mangione, who has been charged in the US with killing UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself.
Google's AI Overviews, which aim to provide concise summaries of search results, have also come under criticism and mockery for errors .

It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to OpenAI, which makes the tools.
Fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.
""Everyone in the entertainment industry, especially all the creative talent, are incredibly worried about what the implications are,"" said Sag-Aftra executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
He said the two companies had contacted the union -  which represents 170,000 media professionals worldwide - to say the agreement specifically rules out the use of the image, likeness or voice of human performers.
But he said it was still a worrying development.
""There's real concern because nobody wants to see human creativity given away to AI models,"" he told BBC News.
The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries.
According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool.
It, of course, also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse.
But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement ""does not include any talent likenesses or voices"".
""The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,"" Disney boss Bob Iger said.
""Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.""
People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026.
The deal comes amid reports Disney lawyers sent Google a cease-and-desist letter on Wednesday accusing the tech firm of infringing its copyrights ""on a massive scale"".
The BBC has asked Google for a response.
Joel Smith, intellectual property partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said Disney's OpenAI deal showed ""rights owners and major AI developers are moving fast to strike collaborative licensing deals to access content for training and future use"".
Equity, the entertainment trade union, says actors' rights need to be protected. The group is currently balloting thousands of performers asking if they are willing to refuse being digitally scanned on set to push for stronger AI safeguards.
Cathy Sweet, Equity's head of TV and Film, said the deal between Disney and OpenAI reinforced ""exactly why our members are fighting for AI protections"".
""The recorded material that will be sold on as part of this eye-watering big money deal are the result of creatives' professional work, and their rights must be protected,"" she said.
Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures.
In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced ""disrespectful"" depictions of the civil rights leader.
The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry.
Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely.
In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made.
Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father.
In November, Warner Music Group announced plans to launch an AI music venture with technology start-up Suno , a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.

c8dyy47qy82o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyy47qy82o,business,'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down,2025-12-14T00:37:15.608Z,"Disaster, catastrophe and nightmare. That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.
Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.
Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).
""David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,"" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. ""Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.""
If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.
Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.
It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.
President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said ""it's imperative that CNN be sold"".
The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic.
Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.
The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount , another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.
When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is ""superior"" to the Netflix deal.
Whether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.
""I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,"" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.
More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims ""greed is good"" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.
Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.
""Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,"" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. ""He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.""
Warner Bros objected to that characterisation.
""Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,"" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC.
For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.
""Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,"" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.
""I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,"" he says.
Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered ""the talkies"" in 1927.
""I think it's a disaster,"" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. ""This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.""
Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.
""At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,"" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.
Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect ""to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.""
Many in Hollywood want to believe them.
John Evans, a sound technician who dabbles in acting, writing and producing, points to Netflix's loving restoration of The Egyptian Theatre along iconic Hollywood Boulevard as a sign of their good faith.
The Egyptian, a classic 1922 theatre, was the site of the world's first movie premiere – Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks – and had fallen into disrepair before Netflix bought the property in 2020 and gave it a $70m makeover.
""I think it's a good sign,"" Mr Evans said, adding that streaming is how many film workers consume movies and TV like the rest of the world.
On the backlot at Warner Bros, tourists snap selfies in front of the Central Perk cafe set from Friends, and stroll by facades of buildings that stand-in for New York or Los Angeles. Inside the offices and writers' rooms, for those still working, it's business as usual.
""I've gone through seven mergers,"" a producer working on the Warner Bros lot said while developing a new show, explaining it's sad to lose a studio because it means it will be even harder to get shows made and sold with one less customer. ""But if you make good stuff, you make good stuff.""
The producer spoke on the condition of anonymity on the day that Paramount Skydance announced their hostile takeover bid. They said they were too busy to worry about the sale because they were trying to get a show on air – and they wouldn't be surprised if another billionaire or trillionaire made another offer for the studio by the end of all this.
""I joke about Elon walking in and doing this, but he could,"" they said of the Tesla and X owner. ""When you have people worth a trillion dollars, there are no rules.""

cd74gjw1j11o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd74gjw1j11o,business,Big tech bets big on AI - but can India keep pace in the global race?,2025-12-11T02:46:08.850Z,"This week, tech giants Amazon and Microsoft pledged an eye-popping $50bn-plus combined investment in India, putting artificial intelligence (AI) in the spotlight.
Microsoft's Satya Nadella announced his company's largest investment ever in Asia - $17.5bn (£13.14bn) - ""to help build the infrastructure, skills, and sovereign capabilities needed for India's AI-first future"".
Amazon followed suit, and said it was putting in more than $35bn in the country by 2030, with an unspecified chunk of that investment going into boosting AI capabilities.
The announcements come at a particularly interesting juncture.
As fears of an AI bubble swept global markets and tech stock valuations soared, several leading brokerages took a contrarian view on India's AI landscape.
Christopher Wood of Jefferies said the country's stocks were a ""reverse AI trade"". That basically means India should outperform other markets in the world ""if the AI trade suddenly unwinds"" - or simply put, the global bubble bursts.
HSBC also held a similar view, saying Indian equities offered a ""hedge and diversification"" for those uneasy with the ongoing AI rally.
This comes as Mumbai stocks have lagged behind their Asian peers over the past year, with foreign investors moving billions into Korean and Taiwanese AI-driven tech companies in the absence of comparable opportunities in India.
In this backdrop, the Amazon and Microsoft investments provide a much-needed fillip - yet it remains worth asking where India truly stands in the global AI race.
There are no easy answers.
The adoption of AI in India has been rapid. Investments into some parts of the value chain - such as data centres , the physical backbone of AI, or chip-making facilities - have begun trickling in. Just this week, American chipmaker Intel announced a collaboration with Mumbai-based Tata Electronics to manufacture chips locally.
But when it comes to a sovereign AI model, it appears India is continuing to play catch-up.
About a year-and-a-half ago, the Indian government launched an AI mission through which it began supplying start-ups, universities and researchers with high-end computing chips to develop a large homegrown AI model like OpenAI or China's DeepSeek.
According to the federal electronics ministry, the launch of the sovereign model  - which supports more than 22 languages - is imminent. In the interim though, the likes of DeepSeek and OpenAI have made further advances, launching newer variants.
While the government has recognised the need to reduce over-dependence on foreign platforms because of the risk of surveillance and sanctions, India's $1.25bn sovereign mission is a shadow of France's $117bn or Saudi Arabia's $100bn programmes.
The country's ambitions also face numerous other hurdles - from semiconductor availability to skilled talent and fragmented data ecosystems, according to global consultancy EY.
India currently lacks enough computational infrastructure or the billions of dollars of research and development (R&D) investment made over decades that gave China and the US a distinct leg up.
Despite its global strength in AI talent, India struggles to keep its developers at home.
""The current tightening of overseas work visas provides India a window of opportunity to retain domestic talent and attract Indian-origin talent at home. However, given that top-tier AI talent is mobile globally, attractive policy incentives need to be put in place to incentivise relocation to India,"" the EY report says.
China, for example, offers a range of incentives such as ""financial support and subsidies, tax incentives and funding for research and development, special talent visas and fast-track immigration"", the report says.
India has a much higher concentration of AI-skilled professionals than the global average - specifically, 2.5 times more. Policies that retain this talent are not yet in place.
Yet, despite the challenges, India - along with countries like Brazil and the Philippines - punches above its weight in AI, especially in the context of its stage of economic development, an UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) study said.
According to the widely tracked Stanford AI Index 2025, the country ranks among the top five in the world on new companies receiving AI investments.
Last year, 74 new Indian AI startups received funding - a fraction of the more than 1,000  funded in the US.
Indian AI startups raised just $1.16bn privately, compared with over $100bn in the US and nearly $10bn in China.
But there's enough intellectual engagement with AI in India, with the country accounting for 9.2% of AI article publications - slightly more than the US, but behind Europe and China according to the Stanford AI Index.
Experts say India's AI edge may lie less in building costly language models and more in using them downstream to spur entrepreneurship.
""I think in the short term, there's this big concentration of AI in the US. But over the next five-10 years, AI will have a massively democratising effect on the creation of new companies. Small founders and entrepreneurs will be numerous and the downstream effect will be amazing for places like India and the Asia-Pacific,"" Shailendra Singh, managing director of Peak XV Partners which invests in AI start-ups, told the BBC.
Mr Singh says India is seeing a surge in AI-powered consumer apps, with AI startup investments doubling from last year.
Moreover, many Indian startups are now using AI to tackle real-world challenges for millions still on the wrong side of the digital divide.
For example, MahaVISTAAR, an AI app run by the Maharashtra government, delivers vital agricultural information in the local Marathi language, reaching over 15 million farmers.
""The hardest places to make artificial intelligence work are also the places where it matters most. If AI can serve India's classrooms, clinics and farms, it can serve the world,"" Nandan Nilekani, the architect of India's biometric programme, wrote in The Economist magazine last month.
Some of that has already begun to happen, as apps like MahaVISTAAR and others have shown.
AI brings new opportunities, but could disrupt India's IT services sector, which has driven its economy and created millions of jobs over the past 30 years.
As AI upends some of their business functions, India's billion-dollar IT firms will become a key area of ""vulnerability"", according to Jefferies.
That vulnerability is already showing.
Growth in India's IT back offices is slowing , stocks are underperforming, hiring has shrunk and wages have stagnated as the spectre of a new disruptor looms large.

Calvin McDonald, the firm's chief executive, will depart at the end of January after more than seven years at the helm.
The decision comes amid a run of poor sales for Lululemon in the US, its main market, in recent times and its share price falling almost 50% in the past year.
However, this week the company upgraded its annual revenue forecast after better-than-expected sales in the past few months.
Mr McDonald said the decision to leave the company was taken after discussions with the board.
""As we near the end of our five-year strategy, and with our strong senior leadership team in place, we all agree that now is the time for a change,"" he said in a LinkedIn post.
While the Canadian company's latest results revealed a boost to its sales internationally driven by its business in China, its performance in the Americas has been going in the opposite direction.
The brand's share price on the US Nasdaq index peaked in late 2023 and has been on a downward trend since. In September, its shares fell sharply after it warned of the impact tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump would have on its business.
Lululemon's particular concern was over the ending of the so-called de-minimis exemption, a former duty-free loophole for low-cost goods entering America from countries such as China.
Many of the Canadian company's suppliers are based in China, Vietnam and other Asian countries. In September, it estimated the newly-imposed import taxes would cost it about $240m (£178.4m) this year.
However, sales in China and around the rest of the world have been positive, driving its net revenues to the start of November to $2.6bn.
""As we enter the holiday season, we are encouraged by our early performance,"" said Mr McDonald. However, he said that despite good Thanksgiving period, demand had slowed since as consumers continued to look for cheaper products.
Lululemon has faced increasing competition from lower-priced rivals such as Vuori and Alo Yoga for its products.
Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, told the BBC that competition had been ""fierce"", and that the brand needed to ""go back to the drawing board and work out ways to make its products 'must-have' items again"".
Mr Coastworth also said that under Mr McDonald the brand had gone through the ""embarrassment of having to pull its Breezethrough product line after negative reviews and customer complaints about the leggings being uncomfortable to wear"" last year.
The company halted sales of its then newly-launched $98 leggings last summer after shoppers criticized the V-shaped back seam of the tights as ""unflattering"" and others said the seam at the top of the waistband dug into their waists.
Lululemon was also mocked on social media in 2020 for promoting an event about how to ""resist capitalism"".
Lululemon named its finance boss Meghan Frank and chief commercial officer André Maestrini as co-interim chief executives while it searches for a new leader.
Marti Morfitt, chair of the brand's board, thanked Mr McDonald for ""his visionary leadership building Lululemon into one of the strongest brands in retail"".
""During his tenure, Calvin led Lululemon through a period of impressive revenue growth, with differentiated products and experiences that resonated with guests around the world.""
Mr Coatsworth likened Mr McDonalds tenure as ""akin to the highs and lows of an athlete hitting their peak and then rapidly going off the boil"".
""He steered Lululemon to greatness as the athleisure trend boomed, with people happy to pay top dollar for posh leggings.
""Then came a series of mistakes which were compounded by factors outside of the company's control. It's no wonder Lululemon is looking to bring in fresh leadership,"" he added.

cj4q1lddj8go,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go,business,Trump launches $1m 'gold card' immigration visas,2025-12-11T01:10:45.841Z,"President Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).
The card will give buyers a ""direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,"" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.
The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a ""substantial benefit"" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.
It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.
The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in ""record time"" and will require a $1m fee which is ""evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States"", the programme's website said.
Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A ""platinum"" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.
Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.
The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.
When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.
But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at ""high-level"" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, ""we want people that are productive"".
""The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,"" Trump said. ""It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.""
The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.
The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries , mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.
The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.
In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers.
The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.
As some Somali migrants fear what might happen next, the BBC speaks to one deportee in Mogadishu.
The recent Washington Accord was hailed as ""historic"" by the US president but the fighting continues.

Do Kwon, a South Korean national, was co-founder of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, which developed the TerraUSD and Luna digital coins.
Kwon had admitted misleading investors about TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to maintain its value against the US dollar.
He was one of a number of crypto bosses to face charges in the US after digital tokens slumped in 2022, triggering the failure of several companies.
US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer, who handed down the sentence, said the Stanford graduate had repeatedly lied to investors who trusted him with their money.
""This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,"" he said during Thursday's court hearing in Manhattan.
""In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.""
Kwon - who pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud - expressed remorse to the judge.
""I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right,"" he said.
Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors that a computer algorithm had restored its value.
Instead, Kwon had arranged for a trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the coin to artificially boost its value, according to court documents.

Instead, the magazine has recognised the year's most influential figure as ""the architects"" of artificial intelligence (AI).
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, Meta head Mark Zuckerberg, X owner Elon Musk and AI ""godmother"" Fei-Fei Li are among those depicted on one of the magazine's two covers.
Experts say it highlights how quickly AI, and the firms behind it, are reshaping society.
It comes as a boom in the technology, ushered in by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, continues at pace.
Its boss Sam Altman said in September its chatbot is used by around 800 million people every week.
Big tech firms are pouring billions of dollars into AI and the infrastructure behind it in a bid to stay ahead of rivals.
There are two covers this year - one a piece of art depicting the letters AI surrounded by workers, and another a painting focused on the tech leaders themselves.
At Meta, Zuckerberg has reportedly focused the firm around the tech, including its  AI chatbot, which it has embedded in its popular apps.
He, along with Huang, Musk, Li and Altman, appeared on the cover alongside Lisa Su, boss of chipmaker AMD, Anthropic chief Dario Amodei, and Google's AI lab lead Sir Demis Hassabis.
""This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible,"" Time said as it announced its new covers.
""But the risk-averse are no longer in the driver's seat.
""Thanks to Huang, Son, Altman, and other AI titans, humanity is now flying down the highway, all gas no brakes, toward a highly automated and highly uncertain future.""
And the magazine's editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs said ""no one"" had as great an impact in 2025 than ""the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI"".
""Humanity will determine AI's path forward, and each of us can play a role in determining AI's structure and future,"" he said.
Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said 2025 could be seen as a ""tipping point"" for how frequently AI is now used in our day-to-day lives.
""Most consumers use it without even being aware of it,"" he told the BBC.
He said AI is now being crammed into hardware, software and services - meaning it its uptake is ""much faster than during the Internet or mobile revolutions"".
Some people now choose chatbots over search engines and social media to plan holidays , find Christmas gifts and discover recipes .
Others, such as those worried about its energy use, training data and impact on their livelihoods, are opting-out entirely.
Nik Kairinos, founder and chief executive of lab Fountech AI, said the covers were ""an honest assessment"" of the tech's influence, but he felt ""recognition should not be confused with readiness"".
""At this moment, AI can still be a saviour or scourge to humanity,"" he said.
""We are still in the early stages of building AI systems that are dependable, accountable, and aligned with human values.
""For those of us developing the technology and bringing AI tools to market, there is huge responsibility.""
This isn't the first time the Person of the Year has been a large group, with Ebola fighters being handed it in 2014 and whistleblowers in 2002.
Previously, in 1982, it recognised the computer, with the magazine saying Americans had a ""giddy passion"" for the device.
Time called it ""partly fad"", but said it was also ""partly a sense of how life could be made better"".
The computer was represented by a number of tech entrepreneurs of the time, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and IBM president John Opel.
Then in 2006, the Person of the Year was given to ""You"" - intended to represent the power of individuals online.
Wikipedia contributors, early YouTubers and MySpace users were noted as examples of ""the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing"".

clyd9nxezjyo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd9nxezjyo,business,The new breed of 'shoplifting entrepreneurs' fuelling the UK's petty crime problem,2025-12-12T08:21:10.249Z,"Listen to Jim read this article
Behind the counter of his convenience store, surrounded by rows of crisps, sandwiches and spirits, Muhammed Rabani glances at a bank of CCTV screens, anticipating a shoplifter coming at any moment.
Muhammed has grown wearily used to the crime. ""It's every day,"" he says. He estimates it is costing the family business in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, around £900 every month.
When asked if thieves ever get violent, he holds his hand up to show a cut covered by a plaster. The previous day, he confronted a shoplifter who tried to steal a full box of chocolates: ""I told him to stop... and he hit me.""
Shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales were up 13% in the year to June 2025, with 529,994 instances recorded according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there have been ""sharp rises"" in shop theft since the coronavirus pandemic.
It's a similar story in Scotland. The Scottish Government's police recorded crime statistics for the year ending September 2025 showed a 15% increase, from 42,271 to 48,564 shoplifting offences.
Northern Ireland saw a 3.9% reduction in police recorded shoplifting offences in the year to November 2025, but shoplifting offences there have risen sharply since Covid, too.
Cleveland - which covers Stockton-on-Tees as well as areas such as Middlesbrough and Redcar - appears to be England and Wales's shoplifting capital. Figures show its police force recorded the highest number of shop theft offences - with 13.6 offences per 1,000 population.
And with the festive shopping season in full swing, retailers are braced for a shoplifting surge.
""We always see a spike in the run-up to Christmas - there's a huge demand for stolen goods,"" says criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor from City St George's, University of London.
Experts say that the nature of shoplifting itself is changing, with a greater range of offenders targeting a more diverse range of goods. So who are the modern day shoplifters and what can be done to tackle them?
The statistics around shoplifting are notoriously tricky to analyse because retail experts and shops alike agree they don't reflect the true scale of the crime.
A study this year by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) ""put it at 20 million incidents [annually], which would suggest that fewer than 3% of shop thefts are even reported,"" Prof Taylor points out.
According to the ONS, the latest statistics show the increases in shoplifting appear to be slowing down. But for shops in Stockton, it doesn't feel that way.
Retail experts have also highlighted that after shoplifters have been reported to the police, shopkeepers often feel no action is taken.
And there is evidence to back this up. Almost 290,000 shoplifting investigations out of around 520,000 were closed with no suspect identified in 2024-25, according to House of Commons Library research revealed by the Liberal Democrats.
Meanwhile, figures obtained by the BBC show the average time it takes for a shoplifting case to be dealt with from offence to completion in a magistrates' court in England and Wales has risen from 32 days in 2014 to 59 days in 2024.
Prof Taylor says these figures reveal the ""crux"" of the problem: ""There appears to be no consequence if you steal and if you're violent, and if you're a prolific offender it takes a long time for any action to actually be taken.""
Former Det Ch Insp David Spencer, who now works for the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, says the consequences of shoplifting are felt much more widely: ""This type of crime has the potential to completely knock out the economic viability of small towns,"" he says.
Many of those working in the retail sector point to the fact that shoplifting has evolved in recent years - with different categories of shoplifters emerging.
One of the biggest developments, experts and retail staff agree, has been the rise of organised criminal gangs.
""We get groups of three or four that come in and use distraction techniques,"" says a supermarket worker from Teesside who contacted Your Voice, Your BBC News. The worker described it as ""really bad"", adding ""it's got worse"".
In 2024, the National Business Crime Solution (NBCS) - an organisation which works with 100 businesses to tackle retail crime - said it was tracking 63 organised criminal groups across the UK who have stolen at least £2.4m of goods in five years. Of these, it told us, 26 groups originate from the UK and Ireland and the rest predominantly from Eastern European countries.
Lucy Whing, a crime policy adviser for retail trade body, the BRC, says this is a huge concern for its members: ""You hear of these gangs systemically hitting stores one after another all over the country.""
This trend appears to have become an issue in more affluent areas of Cleveland, like Yarm, a pretty market town a short drive from Stockton.
When I visit, the high street is full Christmas shoppers enjoying its pubs, restaurants and independent shops.
Abigail Donaldson, who owns high-end streetwear shop, Triad, believes the relatively expensive items she sells has made her shop a target for organised criminals travelling from out of town to steal.
""We don't get as many young kids coming and stealing here, it's all middle-aged men that know what they're doing,"" she says. ""They are very prepared"" - in that they know what they want and are organised.
David Spencer believes organised criminals have moved into the shoplifting market because it is highly lucrative. ""They can literally take huge amounts of stock out pretty quickly.""
In an age where online resale sites have allowed so many people to dabble in entrepreneurialism, it's perhaps little surprise that among them are also a new breed of what Prof Taylor calls ""shoplifting entrepreneurs"".
She says: ""They might not have really dabbled in criminality before but for some reason, they've latched on to a particular product that they know is easy to steal, it's high value and they can resell it quickly,"" she said.
One popular item which shops have said is regularly stolen to sell online is the collectable soft toys Jellycats. Other items high on the shoplifters' wish-list for resale include perfume and designer clothes.
Ruth Lund, manager of Cherry Hill Garden Centre in nearby Middlesbrough, says this type of shoplifter has become a problem for her business, which has just installed new anti-shoplifting barriers to tackle the problem.
She said they know ""exactly what they're going for"" - including garden furniture and Christmas decorations. Perhaps more surprisingly, bags of gravel and even cans of soft drinks are also targets - and ""they will be out the door before we're even aware that they're in the shop"".
Shoplifting-to-order is also being used to sell on stolen goods by what a 2018 report by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) think tank identified as a traditional shoplifter - somebody funding a Class-A drug addiction. Even before the rise in shoplifting since the pandemic, the CSJ said 70% of shoplifting incidents were committed by these people.
One reformed shoplifter, Keeley Knowles from Telford, Shropshire, says she only stole from shops to feed her habit - focusing on shops in Birmingham's Bullring.
""I went straight for designer handbags, designer belts, sunglasses, you know, the stupidly priced stuff,"" says Keeley, who has now been clean for two years and carries out outreach work with drug users. ""And obviously, my income went up and up and with it, my habit went up and up.""
In Stockton, shop workers pointed to drug and alcohol addiction as fuelling the crime and one street is mentioned above all as the epicentre of the problem - Hartington Road, a row of large terraced houses, many divided up into flats, where lots of people with addiction problems congregate.
A nearby shop manager told us when people come into their store under the effects of drugs ""they don't know what they're doing"" and just grab things and walk out.
""It's very scary, because you don't know if they have needles or what else they may carry,"" he added.
Cleveland Police says its charge and detection rate is above the national average and that it takes a ""proactive"" approach to combating shoplifting.
Ch Insp Jamie Bell, the force's operational lead on retail crime, said: ""While there is still work to do in tackling retail crime, our officers work tirelessly to address the issue and, despite the high volume of offences, continue to deliver strong results.""
One of the big issues with tackling shoplifting is there is no quick-fix solution and a wide range of opinions on how to combat the problem.
A 2024 report by the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee made 15 recommendations on how to combat the issue - which included improving reporting systems, more regulations on the online resale market and more funding for rehabilitation.
Former shoplifter Keeley believes sending shoplifters with addictions to jail is a ""waste of resources"" as it does not treat the root cause of the offending.
She believes there needs to be more targeted recovery programmes for offenders. Prof Taylor says sentences of less than 12 months are ""really ineffective and most people come out worse than they went in"".
David Spencer feels that the police need to be responding more quickly and putting offenders through the criminal justice system.
He said that organised criminals who commit thousands of pounds worth of shoplifting should not be handed suspended or community sentences and instead should be sent to jail for ""lengthy periods of time"".
Steps have been taken to try and combat the issue and there are indications they are having some success.
In October 2023 police and government launched the Retail Crime Action Plan, which committed police to prioritise turning up urgently where violence has been used, where a repeat or prolific offender has been detained or where evidence needs to be promptly secured.
The same year, a group of major retailers agreed to pay around £600,000 to a police operation called Project Pegasus, which used CCTV and data shared by the shops and police to understand shoplifters' tactics.
The operation has seen offenders who were responsible for £8m of theft brought to justice in its first year, according to the National Police Chiefs Council.
Retailers have also stepped up their investment in measures such as CCTV and security guards with a record £1.8bn spent on crime prevention in the year to June 2024, according to the BRC. Lucy Whing of the trade body says it is ""hearing anecdotally that for some some members, things are looking a bit better and perhaps this is off the back of these major investments"".
The Home Office says shop theft ""is completely unacceptable and is blighting our high streets"". A spokesperson says it has announced a ""Winter of Action"" to crack down on crime and its Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee will see 3,000 additional officers in neighbourhood roles by spring 2026.
Last year the government said it was bringing in a new crime bill to target people who steal goods worth less than £200. The policy would be a reversal of 2014 legislation that meant ""low-value"" thefts worth under £200 were subject to less serious punishment. The government has also pledged to bring in a specific offence of assaulting a retail worker. Both moves have been welcomed by the BRC.
Despite this, there is little confidence from some retailers that anything will change soon.
Back in Stockton, Muhammed says he didn't report the shoplifter's assault against him because he ""didn't think anything would be done"".
For all the talk of action, he feels the crime is still not treated seriously. Confronting shoplifters, he says, is ""just a part of working there"".

clykk2yrl9ko,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykk2yrl9ko,business,Reddit launches High Court challenge to Australia's social media ban for kids,2025-12-12T00:02:02.189Z,"Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children.
The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday.
The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.
Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing.
""Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,"" Reddit said in an update on its website.
""There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.""
Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.
""We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,"" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month.
In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes ""the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters"".
""Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,"" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed.
The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise.
Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.
And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.
But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.
In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the ""bold"" action from Australia but said ""it shouldn't have come to this"".
""We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.""
Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.
Reddit said the law forces ""intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors"", isolates teens engaging in ""age-appropriate community experiences"" and creates an ""illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't"".
""There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.""
The case is not ""an attempt to avoid compliance"" or ""an effort to retain young users for business reasons"", it added.
""Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,"" it said.
The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.

cn8e5ke4v70o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8e5ke4v70o,business,Can Japan get more female business leaders?,2025-12-08T00:04:53.571Z,"In October Japan got its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Her rise has been hailed as a ground-breaking moment for Japanese women, but some fear that her conservative politics won't change the country's gender inequality situation.
There's one thing that both her proponents and detractors agree on - Japan needs more women in leadership positions in both business and government.
The country has remarkably low gender equality relative to its high level of economic development. This year, it ranked 118th out of 148 countries on the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index.
That makes it the worst performing among the 38 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of free market democracies.
The Japanese government did set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade. Currently the level for businesses is 11.1%.
But change is slowly underway.
""Japan actually has done a really good job increasing female labour market participation,"" says Yumiko Murakami, co-founder of MPower Partners, Japan's first female-led venture capital (VC) company. VC firms invest in start-up companies.
The percentage of women aged 15-64 working has steadily increased over the past 15 years, surpassing the OECD average in the early 2010s, and going above 77% this year. That's higher than the 70% recorded in the US.
Japan's ageing population and labour shortages have made more women finding paid work an economic necessity for the country.
Ms Murakami also points to key policy interventions as an important factor. Such as the government moving to reduce nursery waiting lists, so that young mothers can return to the workforce more quickly.
There is, however, a catch – women in Japan earn on average only 70 to 80% of their male counterparts' wages, according to a 2024 government survey.
That's something Ms Murakami and her co-founders are aiming to change. Their firm's WPower fund focuses solely on supporting female founders and women-empowerment businesses.
""There are really, really interesting and good female founders or minority founders,"" says Ms Murakami. ""But they may not get the same level of access to capital in the same way as male founders do, which creates opportunities for people like us [as investors].""
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government put up capital for half the fund, with the remainder coming from private sector companies.
Ms Murakami says it was encouraging how much interest they received. But she warns that the ""clubby [male] environment"" in Japan's wider VC community makes it tough for female entrepreneurs trying to get funding, or even access to information.
""The venture capital industry is very closed in a way. If you're in, if you're an insider, then it's great because you are connected with everybody and the information travels really quickly.
""But, if you are not, then it's really hard - you just don't get a lot of information. The sheer number of female founders is just tiny.
""And therefore, because there's no critical mass, they are really not part of the core of this small start-up village. And therefore, in my opinion we need to create critical mass.""
The gender imbalance - female entrepreneurs and male cheque-writers - has also led to sexual harassment cases. More than half of female entrepreneurs said they had experienced sexual harassment in the past year, according to a 2024 survey.
The topic has gained increasing media attention in Japan, with several victims reporting sexual assault or being pressured to exchange sexual favours for investment. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced a government survey in August 2025 to assess the scope of the problem.
Startup Lady is a support organisation focussed on female company founders - and safety is a key concern. Moeko Suzuki co-founded the organisation with her business partners a decade ago, when they realised there was a gap in support in Japan for aspiring or early-stage female entrepreneurs of all nationalities.
""We started to think that we should create some safe space for women, and also a place for female entrepreneurs to get together, talk about business, ease their mind, and also get the mindset,"" Ms Suzuki says. ""We wanted to create somewhere very, very safe for female entrepreneurs in Japan, even if they're not Japanese.""
This year, they are collaborating with a local government in Tokyo to run a series of lectures and workshops on topics from fundraising to how to close a deal, with one-to-one mentoring sessions and opportunities for networking.
So far, however, the events have attracted more non-Japanese female entrepreneurs than Japanese. Ms Suzuki says there's still a lack of female role models in Japan to inspire younger generations.
Gender stereotypes persist in education. The country has one of the lowest percentages of female students in stem subjects (sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) compared to other OECD nations.
At Tokyo University, considered one of Japan's most prestigious educational institutions, only 20% of undergraduates are women, and even fewer are researchers.
To tackle this, the university launched an initiative called UTokyo Gender Equity #WeChange in 2022. The target is to increase the ratio of female faculty members from 16% in 2022 to 25% by the end of the 2027 academic year.
To help achieve this it is providing subsidies to departments that hire female faculty members, in some cases subsidising the costs of the new hires for up to three years or five years. So far, the ratio has risen to almost 18%.
Prof Kaori Hayashi, Tokyo University's executive vice president who is spearheading the initiative, says progress has been slow but significant.
The problem, she cautions, is they're still facing a limited candidate pool. Girls are sometimes actively discouraged from pursuing stem or entering Tokyo University.
To counteract this early-stage gender bias, the university runs outreach programs, sending female students back to their high schools to talk about life on campus and serve as role models.
Undoubtedly, the most visible role model for women in Japan, however, is the newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who heads Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Some have applauded her rise as the shattering of the glass ceiling, in a country that has extremely low female political empowerment compared to its OECD counterparts.
Others, however, bemoan her conservative viewpoints, such as her opposition to proposed legislation that would allow women to keep separate surnames after marriage. They worry little will change.
""I understand that some people are encouraged by the idea that a woman can become prime minister, but I don't think it will lead to the realisation of gender equality policies,"" says youth activist Momoko Nojo.
But in a country trying to open the doors to more female leaders across all sectors, it's impossible to ignore the significance of Sanae Takaichi's election. Whether some consider her a role model or not, a precedent has been set that women in Japan can become leaders at the very top.
The women's rights activist, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023, was arrested by Iranian security services at a memorial, her supporters say.

cp34442z25ko,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34442z25ko,business,US TikTok investors in limbo as deal set to be delayed again,2025-12-13T00:32:28.133Z,"A billionaire investor keen on buying TikTok's US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms.
The US has repeatedly delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, Bytedance, must sell or be blocked for American users.
US President Donald Trump appears poised to extend the deadline for a fifth time on Tuesday.
""We're just standing by and waiting to see what happens,"" investor Frank McCourt told BBC News.
""But if the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the capital to buy it - we'll see.""
The popular short-form video app was due to be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a law passed by Congress in 2024.
Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, and expressed fears Beijing could force the company to hand over data on US users.
It's a concern TikTok and its owners have always said is unfounded.
The law was signed by President Joe Biden while he was still in office and was upheld by the Supreme Court in early 2025.
Trump and members of his administration have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done , and had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The president has also said ""sophisticated"" US investors would acquire the app , including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies' Michael Dell.
Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal would be formalised in a meeting between Trump and Xi in October - however it concluded without an agreement being reached.
Neither TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, despite Trump's claims.
This time there are no such claims a deal is imminent, leading most analysts to conclude another extension is inevitable.
Without naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned ""about a concentration of power and influence because platforms like TikTok are very influencing"".
He is part of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary.
""My hope would be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, and lands in the hands of people that comply with the law,"" he said.
He said he wants to operate TikTok without any of its Chinese technology, including its powerful recommendation algorithm, and that his Project Liberty has developed other technology that could be used instead.

Both Democratic and Republican plans fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance, meaning insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, are on course to more than double at the end of the year.
Opinion polls show a vast majority of Americans favour a subsidy extension, with cost of living a major concern for voters.
The issue has caused a rift among Republicans, with healthcare poised to emerge as a hot issue in next year's congressional elections.
More than 24 million people have health insurance through Obamacare.
The subsidies set to expire on 1 January are additional tax credits that Democrats passed in 2021 during the Covid pandemic.
On Thursday, senators rejected both a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years as well as a Republican proposal to create a new health savings account for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level.
The Republican-backed plan failed 51 votes to 48, and the Democrat one fell short by the same margin.
Four Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, both of Alaska, voted for the Democratic bill.
Speaking ahead of the votes, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, warned Republicans it was the last chance to act before the subsidies expire.
""Let's avert a disaster,"" he said. ""The American people are watching.""
A congressional standoff over the expiring subsidies provoked the longest ever US government shutdown, lasting 43 days, this autumn.
Republicans have long argued Obamacare is rife with fraudulent claims and that it failed to deliver the affordable coverage promised in the bill's title.
They say health savings accounts would benefit consumers directly rather than insurance companies.
While Trump did not publicly support that Republican plan, he said in an interview with Politico earlier this week that he wants ""to give money to the people, not to the insurance companies"".
Before senators voted on Thursday, Senate majority leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, again spoke out against the extension of those subsidies.
He described them as an ""attempt to disguise the real impact of Obamacare's spiralling healthcare costs"".
While some Republicans on Capitol Hill have called for compromise or to extend the subsidies until an agreement with Democrats can be reached, there has so far been no high-level negotiations on the topic.
Speaking at the White House on Thursday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt laid the blame on Democrats and said the Covid-era health insurance subsidies had ""completely distorted the health insurance market"".
She added that Trump and Republicans ""are currently coming up with creative solutions and ideas"" to lower healthcare costs, although she provided no details.
The issue is one that polls suggest has unified many voters, regardless of political affiliation.
One survey, released by KFF in November, found that 74% of Americans supported extending enhanced ACA credits.
Some Republicans have warned that a failure to fix the problem could cost them their legislative majorities in next November's vote.
""If we fumble this healthcare bill, nothing else is going to matter,"" Florida Republican congressman John Rutherford told Politico.

crmddnge9yro,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmddnge9yro,business,Trump signs order to block states from enforcing own AI rules,2025-12-12T15:02:57.880Z,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.
""We want to have one central source of approval,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.
It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most ""onerous"" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.
The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.
AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology.
But the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition.
While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House.
This year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.
Those rules range widely.
One in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models.
In North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright.
Oregon brought in a law prohibiting a ""non-human entity"" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse.
Critics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.
""Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,"" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.
California's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order.
""Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,"" he said.
AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice.
""We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,"" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.
Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict.
""It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,"" he said. But, he added: ""That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.""

cwyp7v7r28yo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp7v7r28yo,business,UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.1% in October,2025-12-12T12:00:03.036Z,"The UK's economy shrank unexpectedly in the lead up to the Budget, according to the latest official figures.
The economy contracted by 0.1% in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, whereas economists had been expecting it to grow by 0.1%. The economy also shrank by 0.1% in the three months to October.
The cyber-attack at Jaguar Land Rover continued to affect car production, with only a slight recovery in October from the previous month's fall, while analysts said uncertainty ahead of the Budget had slowed consumer and business spending.
The weaker-than-expected figures strengthen the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting next week, analysts said.
The government has made economic growth one of its key priorities.
A Treasury spokesperson said the government was working to boost economic growth through reducing energy bills and major infrastructure investments.
""We are determined to defy the forecasts on growth and create good jobs, so everyone is better off, while also helping us invest in better public services,"" the spokesperson said.
Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride blamed the Budget for the unexpected contraction, saying it was ""a direct result of Labour's economic mismanagement"".
""For months, Rachel Reeves has misled the British public. She said she wouldn't raise taxes on working people - she broke that promise again. She insisted there was a black hole in the public finances - but there wasn't.""
Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the surprise contraction in the economy was ""a further reason to expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates next Thursday.""
""It's striking that the economy has only grown in one of the past seven months,"" she said.
Over the three months to October, production output shrank by 0.5%, largely driven by a 17.7% fall in vehicle manufacturing.
The cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover halted production at its plants across the UK for the whole of September, and there was a staged return to factory activity from early October .
The resumption of vehicle manufacturing helped lift production output across the UK for that month, which grew by 1.1%.
However, the ONS noted the rebound in vehicle manufacturing had been small, as it was still well below levels seen in August.
The services sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the economy and includes areas such as professional services and retailing, did not grow at all in the three months to October.
October's contraction comes after the economy shrank by 0.1% in September and was flat in August.
The monthly GDP figures are more volatile than the rolling three-month data, which is considered to give a better underlying picture of growth.
But Jack Meaning, UK chief economist at Barclays bank and a former adviser at the Bank of England, told the BBC's Today programme the latest figures showed the economy was ""unambiguously weak"".
""It's continuing the story we've seen more or less all the way through this year of growth decelerating from relatively strong numbers at the start to much weaker numbers now, and actually outright contraction,"" he said.
""Ultimately part of the story today is that we didn't see as much of a bounce-back of that Jaguar Land Rover closure as we had expected. We thought that would all bounce back pretty quickly; it looks like it might take a little bit longer.""
Mr Meaning added that data from Barclays indicated that the uncertainty ahead of the Budget weighed on the economy as people ""held off purchases and big spending decisions"".
Scott Gardner, investment strategist at JP Morgan Personal Investing, said Budget speculation ahead of the chancellor's speech ""had a numbing effect"" on spending.
""Budget speculation and uncertainty around potential tax changes dampened the mood among businesses and consumers, leading some to delay key decisions until the Budget had been delivered,"" he said.
Card and gift retailer Card Factory said on Friday it had been affected by pressures on consumers which had hit ""confidence and shopping behaviour"", adding it was cutting its profit forecast due to weaker than expected sales.
Fergus Jimenez-England, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the chancellor's increase to her financial buffer in the Budget ""should help reduce uncertainty over the coming year"", but it was unclear whether that would strengthen economic activity.
But KPMG UK's chief economist Yael Selfin said investment from the private sector and government ""could help foster growth over the coming year"".
""As a result, we expect investment to remain a key contributor to growth going into 2026,"" she said.

cwywp3y35ryo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywp3y35ryo,business,UK pharma boss says US is the best country to invest in,2025-12-11T10:53:38.035Z,"While successive governments have stressed that the UK is a superpower in life sciences, in the eyes of one of the country's biggest pharmaceutical companies, the US is the best place to invest.
The boss of the vaccines and medicines giant GSK, Dame Emma Walmsley, has told the BBC the company will invest $30bn (£23bn) in the US by the end of this decade.
The cash injection across the pond comes as other major drug makers have pulled UK projects worth billions after years of frustration over NHS drug budgets and pressure from President Donald Trump to set up production in the states.
And despite a new deal which will see the NHS pay more as part of a zero tariffs deal on shipping UK pharmaceuticals to America , Dame Emma is not going to ""shy away"" from GSK's US investment plans.
The US is where the pharma giant makes more than half its turnover and is ""still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines,"" she says.
Alongside China, it is ""the best market in the world to do business development"".
GSK's latest stateside investment drive followed US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.
UK drug maker AstraZeneca has also announced it is pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility while ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the US.
Other drug companies have also said there is little appetite to invest in the UK, which successive governments have insisted is a life sciences superpower.
Dame Emma, who will leave GSK in January after eight years at the helm, stressed that GSK remains committed to the UK, noting that the interview was being carried out in its new global headquarters in London.
""No one should be deluded that the UK is going to be a massive scale market, a domestic market, but it can be an exporter of innovation in life sciences,"" she says.
""For GSK, it's 2% of our sales are here. More than 50% are in the US. But we're very heavily invested, and remain committed to being invested in terms of manufacturing and research and development.""
Despite challenges facing Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, Dame Emma welcomes the deal to scrap tariffs on UK drug shipments to the US as ""a step in the right direction"" for Britain.
The deal means the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS - in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.
Dame Emma says it is a welcome reversal of a long term decline in the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines compared to other countries' health systems.
The move, she suggests, will encourage the kind of innovation that supports ground-breaking new medicines, such as GSK's new asthma drug which can be taken twice a year and could slash hospital admissions by 70% for serious asthma sufferers.
GSK hopes the new treatment will be approved for use by the NHS within weeks.
Asked about the health of the UK, Dame Emma says there are ""social demographic root causes"" for its decline.
She says health outcomes vary widely depending on where you live: ""You can probably get a 10 or 15-year difference in lifespan prospects depending on which postcode you're in.""
Dame Emma pointed to British diets and a lack of education around nutrition as part of the problem.
""I think there's no question that the food system is fundamentally something we need to look at harder.""
Dame Emma also opened up about the differences she has experienced between the NHS and the private healthcare system in the US, having given birth in London, Paris and twice in New York.
""Both the experience of childbirth and all the follow up that happens afterwards are very, very different,"" she says. ""Anything from the advice you're given.. .the frequency with which you are expected to be visited, how long you are in hospital and what kind of follow-up advice.""
Dame Emma added what matters is the balance of price, access and outcomes, and that the NHS still has ""work to do"" on getting the balance right.
Dame Emma, who also sits on the board of Microsoft, says the world is on the cusp of major advances in health science thanks in part to advances in AI which promise to accelerate innovation
""90% of the projects in our industry don't work, they take a decade and cost billions. Getting to a place where you just double that to you know, instead of 10% working, 20% working will completely change the trajectory of innovation.""
In the end, she adds, few things are more important than health. ""It is one of the few things that every single person on the planet ends up caring about.""

cx257k3n2g1o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx257k3n2g1o,business,Fed lowers interest rates but future cuts uncertain,2025-12-11T06:58:01.580Z,"The US Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates for the third time this year, even as internal divisions create uncertainty about additional cuts in the coming months.
The central bank said on Wednesday it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years.
But policymakers disagree about how the Fed should balance competing priorities: a weakening job market on the one hand, and rising prices on the other.
The Fed's economic projections released on Wednesday suggest one rate cut will take place next year, although new data could change this.
Fed chair Jerome Powell said central bankers needed time to see how the Fed's three cuts this year work their way through the US economy. Policymakers will  examine incoming data closely ahead of the Fed's next meeting in January, he added.
""We are well-positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves,"" Powell told reporters.
Those hoping for interest rates to keep coming down, including President Donald Trump, might have to wait.
The Fed is facing a ""very challenging situation"" as it confronts risks of rising inflation and unemployment, Powell said, adding: ""You can't do two things at once"".
The decision to lower rates on Wednesday was not unanimous, suggesting widening divisions among central bankers over the outlook for the US economy.
Three Fed officials broke ranks and officially dissented.
Stephen Miran, who is on leave from his post leading Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, voted for a larger 0.5 percentage point cut.
Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to hold rates steady.
Trump, who has repeatedly urged Powell to lower rates, said after the meeting on Wednesday that the Fed's cut could have been ""at least doubled"".
""Our rates should be much lower,"" he said at a roundtable at the White House. ""We should have the lowest rates in the world.""
A data blackout during the longest-ever US government shutdown, which ended in November, has left policymakers partially in the dark about the state of the economy. But concerns about a slowing job market continue to outweigh inflation fears, at least for now.
The unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, Labor Department figures showed in a delayed report released last month . Cutting interest rates is aimed at stimulating the job market by creating lower borrowing costs for businesses.
Inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. In September, it hit 3% for the first time since January.
But while tariffs appear to be boosting some consumer prices, recent milder-than-expected inflation readings have allowed the Fed to focus on boosting the labour market by lowering rates, analysts said.
Colleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said higher-than-target inflation made it trickier for the Fed to cut rates, but the jobs market appeared to have nudged them in that direction.
She expects one to two more rate cuts next year.
""I think the conundrum in the states at the moment is that there's a lot of political pressure on the Fed chair and the committee there to cut rates,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.
Policymakers remain divided over the path forward for interest rates.
Asked about disagreement among policymakers, Powell acknowledged that it was ""unusual"" to have ""persistent tension"" between the Fed's two mandates to keep prices stable and unemployment low.
""And when you do, this is what you see,"" he said, referring to growing divisions.
But Powell characterised the internal debate between Fed officials as thoughtful and respectful.
""We come together and we reach a place where we can make a decision,"" he said.
Central bankers are poised to have a bit more clarity next week, with the expected release of official data on the labour market and inflation for November.
The incoming data could shift policymakers' outlook, potentially bolstering calls for further easing next year if there are new signs that the job market is stalling.
Trump's search for Powell's replacement as Fed chair, once his term ends next May, is adding to uncertainty about the path forward for Fed policy.
Trump could announce his pick as soon as within the next few weeks.
Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as the front-runner to succeed Powell.
A Trump loyalist, Hassett served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council.
He has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy, doubling down on allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and backing Trump's handling of the Fed.
Hassett's allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently.
Other names that have been floated for the Fed chair include economist Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.
Trump is ""still making up his mind, and he's looking for someone who will be in his way of thinking,"" Thomas Hoenig, a distinguished senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, told the BBC.
The candidates, he added, ""have to project that they will be independent, or the markets will become quite nervous - and that will create more volatility"".
Asked on Wednesday whether Trump's search for a new Fed chair is hindering his job or changing his thinking, Powell responded with a resounding ""no"".
The recent Washington Accord was hailed as ""historic"" by the US president but the fighting continues.
It comes despite US President Donald Trump saying both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal.
The lawsuit comes as Donald Trump continues to question his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, despite any reliable evidence.

Mike Jeffries was declared ""mentally incompetent"" by a court in May and said to be suffering with dementia and late onset of Alzheimer's disease. A judge ordered him to be treated for up to four months to see if he was likely to regain competency.
US prosecutors now say that medical experts have found him competent to stand trial.
Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their alleged middleman, James Jacobson, 72. All three deny the allegations.
Mr Jeffries, 81, was released from FMC Butner - a federal prison in North Carolina for men with special health needs - in late November, according to court documents.
Writing to Judge Nusrat Choudhury, prosecutors said that prison officials had concluded that Mr Jeffries was ""able to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him and to assist properly in his own defense"".
In a court hearing on Thursday, assistant US attorney Megan Farrell said this followed an assessment by a neuropsychologist and psychologist.
A final competency hearing will be set for early 2026 with prosecutors requesting a trial date for October next year, the court heard.
One alleged victim, who asked to remain anonymous as he's been interviewed by the FBI as part of its criminal investigation, said he was shocked and relieved by the latest opinion that Mr Jeffries is fit to stand trial.
""For the first time, it feels like we're now moving toward a future where he must answer for what happened and for what so many of us endured.
""It means the truth could finally be heard in a courtroom, and for survivors, that moment for accountability has been a long time coming.
""I hope the system will finally require him to stand up and face the weight of everything he's spent years avoiding.""
The former fashion executive and two others were  charged with running an international sex-trafficking and prostitution business from at least 2008-2015.
All three have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Federal prosecutors accused them of using their money and influence to prey on vulnerable men for their own sexual gratification and said they used force, fraud and coercion to make aspiring models engage in ""violent and exploitative"" sexual acts.
Their arrests followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the trio had been at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex around the world while Mr Jeffries was chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch.
In March, a court ruled that Abercrombie & Fitch had to pay for Mr Jeffries' criminal defence costs - a figure lawyers say is likely to run into millions - as a result of an indemnification agreement he signed while stepping down in 2014.
Then, in May, Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which was supported by two medical experts.
Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries, his partner Matthew Smith and Abercrombie & Fitch have been defending multiple civil lawsuits brought by alleged victims.
Earlier this year, the BBC revealed that more than 40 men have now come forward with civil allegations of rape, sexual assault or drugging, accusations Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith ""vehemently deny"".
Abercrombie & Fitch did not respond to requests for comment, though it has previously said that it had no knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct or sex trafficking and ""up until the moment that the BBC's reporting was released in October 2023, there was nothing public about the allegations against Jeffries"".
It said that new leadership had since transformed the company, and it has ""zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind"".",674,data/raw/business_cx2gg9gzqxxo.html
cy95pr790pro,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy95pr790pro,business,Venezuela says Trump wants its oil. But is that the case?,2025-12-12T05:42:29.469Z,"Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro says escalating pressure from the US comes down to one thing: Washington wants to grab the South American nation's vast oil reserves.
This week the American military seized an oil tanker, which was allegedly carrying Venezuelan oil being shipped in violation of US sanctions, and threatened action against other ships.
The move followed a series of military strikes on Venezuelan boats, which the US alleges are drug-trafficking vessels. President Donald Trump has called on Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.
So is it Venezuela's oil that Trump really wants? And would it actually be worth it?
It is true that with an estimated 303 billion barrels, Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves.
But the amount of oil the country actually produces today is tiny by comparison.
Output has dropped off sharply since the early 2000s, as former President Hugo Chavez and then the Maduro administration tightened control over the state-run oil company, PDVSA, leading to an exodus of more experienced staff.
Though some Western oil firms, including the US company Chevron, are still active in the country, their operations have shrunk significantly as the US has widened sanctions and targeted oil exports, aiming to curb Maduro's access to a key economic lifeline.
Sanctions - which the US first put in place in 2015 during President Barack Obama's administration over alleged human rights violations - have also left the country largely cut off from the investment and the parts it needs.
""The real challenge they've got is their infrastructure,"" says Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec.
In November, Venezuela produced an estimated 860,000 barrels per day, according to the latest oil market report from the International Energy Agency.
That is barely a third of what it was 10 years ago and accounts for less than 1% of world oil consumption.
Some in the US have made the case for intervention in Venezuela by pointing to the opportunities for American businesses to revive the oil industry.
""Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,"" Florida Republican congresswoman María Elvira Salazar said in a recent interview on Fox Business.
""American companies can go in and fix all the oil pipes, the whole oil rigs and everything that has to do with... oil and the derivatives.""
Trump might seem open to such arguments.
He campaigned on the slogan ""drill, baby, drill"" and has generally called for expanding oil production, which he has tied to lower prices for Americans.
But when it comes to Venezuela, the White House has said it is concerned about drug trafficking and what it sees as Maduro's illegitimacy.
Asked on Thursday whether the US campaign in the region was about drugs or oil, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was focused on ""many things"".
She called stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the US its ""number one"" priority.
Clayton Siegle, a senior fellow for energy security at the think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says he takes such pronouncements ""largely at face value"".
He pointed to the longstanding interest in the region of key players like Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
""I just have not seen the supporting evidence that oil is at the centre of its ambitions,"" he says.
That's not to say that US companies would not be interested.
At the moment, Chevron is the only American oil producer still active in Venezuela, after receiving a licence under former President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate, despite US sanctions.
The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year, though it has revoked exemptions for other firms, such as Spain's Repsol, in a bid to curb the flow of funds to the Maduro regime.
Today, Chevron accounts for about a fifth of Venezuela's oil production.
Analysts say Chevron would be among those best-placed to benefit, should the US start to lift its barriers against dealing with Venezuela.
Refiners in the US, particularly those around the Gulf Coast, are also hungry for the ""heavier"" type of crude that Venezuela produces, which tends to be less expensive and therefore more profitable to process.
""It has been problematic for US Gulf Coast refiners in recent years that Venezuela has been under sanctions and been reducing production, because it means there's less of that heavy crude available,"" says Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler.
""Even if they weren't getting involved in the production side of things, they would be a keen buyer of it.""
While any expansion of oil exports from Venezuela could help bring down prices in the US, analysts say that would take time, with its current output too limited to make a significant impact.
And restoring Venezuela's oil industry to its former glory would be a heavy lift.
According to a recent Wood Mackenzie report , improved management and some modest investments could help boost oil production in Venezuela to about two million barrels per day over the next two years.
But analysts warned it would take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to raise output more significantly.
They also said companies could be put off by potential complications like its membership in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).
Another risk is the outlook for oil demand, as it becomes relatively less important as an energy source, says David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.
""Oil demand is not going to fall off a cliff but it is no longer growing as it was. We see it as subdued and will start falling in the late 2030s,"" he says.
""Anyone investing in the Venezuelan oil sector would have to think, is it worth it?""
Even if Maduro were ousted or US barriers were to lift, Mr Oxley says it is not clear how willing companies would be to commit the time and money it would take to bring Venezuela's oil back online.
""On the oil side, you'd need to see lots and lots of investment. Certainly in the billions,""  he says, ""'Drill, baby, drill' - that's fine but private companies are only going to come in and do it if it's profitable.""
The recent Washington Accord was hailed as ""historic"" by the US president but the fighting continues.
It comes despite US President Donald Trump saying both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal.
The lawsuit comes as Donald Trump continues to question his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, despite any reliable evidence.

The Italian luxury brand will make 2,000 pairs of sandals in India's Maharashtra and Karnataka states, under a deal with two state-backed entities, Reuters news agency reports.
""We'll mix the original manufacturer's standard capabilities with our manufacturing techniques"", Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada's head of Corporate Social Responsibility, said.
The collection is set to go on sale in February 2026, online and in 40 Prada stores across the world.
A pair of sandals are reportedly set to be sold for $939, which amounts to around £800 and 84,000 rupees.
The agreement was signed on Thursday during the Italy-India Business Forum 2025.
In June, Prada courted controversy after it showcased sandals that had an open-toe braided pattern that closely resembled the traditional Kolhapuri sandals made in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Prada described the sandals as ""leather footwear"" but did not mention its Indian origins, prompting backlash and allegations of cultural appropriation in India.
The brand later acknowledged the footwear design's Indian roots.
A Prada spokesperson at that time told the BBC that the company has ""always celebrated craftsmanship, heritage and design traditions"", adding that it was ""in contact with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture on this topic"". This is a prominent industry trade body in the state.
On Friday, Maharashtra's Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat told BBC Marathi that the new initiative will be called 'Prada Made in India – Inspired by Kolhapuri Chappals [sandals]'.
""Keeping in mind Prada's requirements and demand, some artisans will receive special training from Prada and LIDCOM [a state-backed entity supporting the leather industry in Maharashtra]. Additionally, around 200 Kolhapuri chappal artisans will be given three years of training in Italy,"" he said.
Mr Shirsat said the agreement had been signed for five years, but expressed confidence that it would be extended further.
""The state government will also provide financial assistance to the artisans for this purpose,"" he added.
Named after a city in Maharashtra where they are made, Kolhapuri sandals trace their roots back to the 12th Century.
Made from leather and sometimes dyed in natural colours, the traditional handcrafted sandals are sturdy and well-suited to India's hot climate.
Following the controversy, many artisans in Kolhapur said they were saddened by Prada's use of the design without giving due credit.

c2epm0w0zggo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2epm0w0zggo,technology,Google asks UK experts to find uses for its powerful quantum tech,2025-12-12T00:34:11.545Z,"Google has announced plans to team up with the UK to invite researchers to come up with uses for the tech giant's state-of-the-art quantum chip Willow.
It is one of several firms competing to develop a powerful quantum computer - which is seen as an exciting new frontier in the future of computing.
Researchers hope they will be able to crack problems in fields such as chemistry and medicine which are impossible for current computers to solve.
Professor Paul Stevenson of the University of Surrey - who had no involvement with the agreement - told the BBC it was ""great news for UK researchers"".
The collaboration between Google and the UK's national lab for quantum computing means more researchers will get access to the technology.
""The new ability to access Google's Willow processor, through open competition, puts UK researchers in an enviable position,"" said Prof Stevenson.
""It is good news for Google, too, who will benefit from the skills of UK academics.""
Quantum devices work in a fundamentally different way to the computers powering our smartphones and laptops, solving problems using technologies based on the science of particle physics
But the full potential of the technology has yet to be realised and the machines that currently exist have few practical applications and most are experimental.
It is hoped giving UK researchers access to Willow would help ""uncover new real world applications"".
Scientists will be able to submit proposals describing how they intend to use the chip, and they will work with experts from Google and the UK quantum lab to design and conduct experiments.
When it was unveiled in 2024, Google's Willow chip was seen as a significant step forward in the field.
Rival firms including Amazon and IBM are also developing their own tech.
The UK has a significant quantum industry. Quantinuum, which has headquarters in Cambridge and Colorado, US, reached a $10bn (£7.45bn) valuation in September.
Announcements of new developments from firms throughout 2025 have led some experts to believe powerful machines capable of having real-world impact will be developed within a decade.
Dr Michael Cuthbert, Director at the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) said the partnership would ""accelerate discovery"".
He said the cutting edge science it would support could ultimately lead to quantum computing being used in areas such as ""life science, materials, chemistry, and fundamental physics"".
The NQCC already hosts seven quantum computers from British-based firms such as Quantum Motion, ORCA and Oxford Ionics.
The government says it is committing £670m to support the tech, which is a priority area in the UK's Industrial Strategy.
Officials believe quantum could contribute £11 billion to the UK economy by 2045.

c2epm9z9kkvo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2epm9z9kkvo,technology,This Grand Theft Auto creator is back - with a novel about an AI that hijacks your mind,2025-12-14T00:58:34.886Z,"Dan Houser was one of the masterminds behind revolutionary video game series Grand Theft Auto.
Now, after leaving Rockstar Games and launching his own company, he's released a debut novel about a very different type of game.
A Better Paradise is a dystopian vision of the near future in which an AI-led computer game goes rogue.
Set in a polarised world, it finds Mark Tyburn attempting to create a virtual haven for people to find sanctuary and reconnect within themselves against an all-consuming social media hellscape.
But it all goes wrong when it ends up unleashing a mysterious, sentient AI bot named NigelDave into society - ""a hyper-intelligence built by humans"" - flaws included.
Readers get to see his thought processes as he struggles with ""infinite knowledge and zero wisdom"".
""What would an incredibly precocious child, who remembers everything he ever thought - because computers don't forget things - feel like when he started talking?"" Houser says.
It feels a bit like A Better Paradise predicted the future.
First released as a podcast, the book comes as AI's continued boom means the sector's big seven companies are now collectively worth more than China's economy.
But Houser says he began writing the book ""a good year"" before OpenAI's ChatGPT went live to the masses in 2022, complete with a logo eerily similar to his fictional creation.
Instead, it was humanity's technological dependency during Covid - at a scale he'd underestimated - that inspired his thinking.
In his novel - which sometimes feels monologue-heavy - Houser envisions a hyper-digital, alienating world where people retreat from deepening political problems into a spiral of social media and generative AI.
Enter CEO of Tyburn Industria, Mark, who dreams of building the Ark, an immersive gaming experience users can enter in order to reconnect with themselves. It generates a world and mission tailored to each player's innermost wants and needs.
But during testing, the Ark becomes a Pandora's box of addiction. Some players find joy; others encounter terror. One even reconnects with his dead sister.
Meanwhile, a rogue AI bot named NigelDave slips into the real world, manipulating minds and engineering realities no one can control.
Mined for advertising, people are left wondering if their thoughts are genuine. Everything is tracked, and nothing is secure. As climate emergencies intensify, society falls to pockets of civil war.
The only way to escape is to ""drift""- which means hiding from a thousand algorithms by living off-grid, constantly moving and suppressing maddening paranoia that your thoughts are not your own.
To the reader, NigelDave feels like a nightmare ChatGPT gone wrong.
The AI tool recently reached 800 million weekly active users, according to boss Sam Altman, and Houser believes some people are becoming dependent on the technology's affirming ""human veneer"".
Microsoft's head of AI Mustafa Suleyman has warned of a rise in AI psychosis - a non-clinical term describing incidents where people increasingly rely on chatbots like Claude, Grok and ChatGPT and become convinced that something imaginary has become real.
In some cases, the chatbot fuels grandiose fantasies about future opportunities. In others, it presents in a romantic connection. More troubling are reports of parents saying bots have encouraged their children to kill themselves .
In response to the increased scrutiny, ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently tightened its welfare protocols , with updates designed to ensure its chatbot responds ""safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania"".
The dizzying algorithm-fuelled society in which NigelDave is unleashed mirrors ours too.
Parents worry about exposing their children to false information or harmful content. Last year national police chiefs described the ""quite terrifying"" misogynistic radicalisation of boys and young men. And in 2014 Facebook admitted manipulating the news feeds of nearly 700,000 users without their consent to manage the emotions they were exposed to.
""As a parent, you always worry about anything that you expose your kids to that is going to either give them false information or simply bombard them with too much information,"" Houser says.
But is it bold for a video game creator to be warning of these dangers - given the long history of video games themselves being accused of making young people violent?
Houser insists there's a difference.
""We always had the data about game violence, and it was very clear: as people played more video games, youth violence went down.
""Whatever people were claiming, we knew the opposite was true.""
Psychology professor and game violence researcher Pete Etchells says numerous studies have shown ""no meaningful effect of playing violent games on aggression"".
AI models and social media are another matter - a ""new paradigm"" in altering behaviour that gaming never threatened, according to Matt Navarra, social media consultant and author of the Geekout Newsletter.
He says dismissing concerns as a GTA-style moral panic ""understates what is changing"".
""We're talking about external systems that can potentially shape people's beliefs or manipulate attention, personalised experiences, nudge behaviour or even influence identity and emotional states.""
Could Houser have pushed forward with A Better Paradise at Rockstar? ""I don't know if I would have had the bandwidth to think about it,"" he tells me.
He's previously described the fatigue of managing vast open-world sandbox games like Red Dead Redemption and GTA as playing a role in his departure.
The goal with his book was to create ""something truly different in this era of crazy media saturation"".
So where next? He's already writing the second instalment of the series, and plans are under way to develop a video game, for which he promises the visuals are ground-breaking.
A key message, he says, is to not let your device - or AI - ""tell you what to think"". Otherwise, Houser argues, ""you're giving up control to your phone"".
His biggest fear, as creator of worlds, is losing imagination because of the endless torrent of algorithms. Sometimes after scrolling for hours, he realises: ""I've not had an idea all day"".
""If you go offline for a bit - sometimes I make myself go for a walk with no phone, you start to have ideas.
""A human is better thinking than not,"" he says. ""Thinking is a privilege.""
If you've been affected by issues involving suicide or feelings of despair , details of organisations offering advice and support for people in the UK are available from BBC Action Line . Help and support outside the UK can be found at Befrienders Worldwide .
A deal to sell TikTok has remained elusive, despite earlier claims that a deal was done.
Parents and experts say gaming poses many of the same risks for kids as social media, and want them included.

c3r77j5nze5o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r77j5nze5o,technology,Amazon pulls AI recap from Fallout TV show after it made several mistakes,2025-12-12T18:04:47.756Z,"Amazon has pulled a video recap made with artificial intelligence (AI) from its hit TV show Fallout after users said it got several facts wrong about the series.
The firm said in November it was testing the ""first-of-its-kind"" tool in the US to help viewers catch up on some of its shows on streaming service Prime Video - including Fallout, its adaptation of the popular video game franchise.
But it has since disappeared from the site after users highlighted mistakes in its video summarising the events of Fallout season one - including claiming one scene was set more than 100 years earlier than it was.
The BBC has approached Amazon for comment.
The move to apparently press pause on its AI-powered recaps was first reported by tech publication The Verge .
Amazon said in November the recaps would be available to users as an experimental feature, and only ""for select English-language Prime Original series in the US"".
""Video Recaps use AI to summarise a show's most pertinent plot points with a theatrical-quality video that includes narration, dialogue, and music,"" it said .
But fans eagerly awaiting the release of the next series of Fallout on 17 December highlighted errors introduced in its video recap for its first series.
Users on Reddit said a clip showing The Ghoul - one of the show's central characters, played by actor Walton Goggins - was wrongly described in the AI narration as a ""1950s flashback"".
Despite the clip's retro aesthetic, it actually depicts a scene in 2077 - something fans of the series would know instantly.
Fans also said the recap incorrectly summarised a scene between The Ghoul and protagonist Lucy MacLean, played by Ella Purnell, altering their dynamic in a way that would confuse new viewers.
It joins a long list of errors have being introduced when using generative AI tools to produce content summaries.
In early 2025, Apple suspended an AI feature summarising notifications after it drew complaints for repeated mistakes in its summaries of news headlines.
The BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature , after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers Luigi Mangione, who has been charged in the US with killing UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself.
Google's AI Overviews, which aim to provide concise summaries of search results, have also come under criticism and mockery for errors .

c5ydp1gdqwqo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydp1gdqwqo,technology,Creative industries 'incredibly worried' about OpenAI-Disney deal,2025-12-12T11:46:00.109Z,"A union representing workers in the creative industries says there is ""real concern"" among its members about a $1bn (£740m) deal which will see Disney characters brought to ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora.
It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to OpenAI, which makes the tools.
Fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.
""Everyone in the entertainment industry, especially all the creative talent, are incredibly worried about what the implications are,"" said Sag-Aftra executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
He said the two companies had contacted the union -  which represents 170,000 media professionals worldwide - to say the agreement specifically rules out the use of the image, likeness or voice of human performers.
But he said it was still a worrying development.
""There's real concern because nobody wants to see human creativity given away to AI models,"" he told BBC News.
The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries.
According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool.
It, of course, also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse.
But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement ""does not include any talent likenesses or voices"".
""The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,"" Disney boss Bob Iger said.
""Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.""
People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026.
The deal comes amid reports Disney lawyers sent Google a cease-and-desist letter on Wednesday accusing the tech firm of infringing its copyrights ""on a massive scale"".
The BBC has asked Google for a response.
Joel Smith, intellectual property partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said Disney's OpenAI deal showed ""rights owners and major AI developers are moving fast to strike collaborative licensing deals to access content for training and future use"".
Equity, the entertainment trade union, says actors' rights need to be protected. The group is currently balloting thousands of performers asking if they are willing to refuse being digitally scanned on set to push for stronger AI safeguards.
Cathy Sweet, Equity's head of TV and Film, said the deal between Disney and OpenAI reinforced ""exactly why our members are fighting for AI protections"".
""The recorded material that will be sold on as part of this eye-watering big money deal are the result of creatives' professional work, and their rights must be protected,"" she said.
Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures.
In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced ""disrespectful"" depictions of the civil rights leader.
The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry.
Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely.
In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made.
Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father.
In November, Warner Music Group announced plans to launch an AI music venture with technology start-up Suno , a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.

With more than one in three UK residents now using AI to support their mental health or wellbeing according to Mental Health UK, university researchers say the study highlights the key to effective chatbot therapy, and the risks of ""synthetic intimacy"".
The research, published in Social Science & Medicine journal on Tuesday, is based on feedback from 4,000 users of Wysa, which is a mental health app.
Ramakant Vempati, founder and president at Wysa, said the company ""welcomed rigorous research"" into how people experience AI support.
""When interpreted in the right clinical context, these insights show how AI can responsibly improve access to safe and engaging support, by augmenting existing systems, and not by replacing them,"" he added.
""Our self-help tool 'Everyday Mental Health by Wysa' has clear governance, safeguarding and is designed to work alongside human-led services.""
Wysa says it has about 420,000 consumer app downloads in the UK.
The University of Sussex study reported that users commonly referred to the app as a ""friend, companion, therapist and even occasionally partner"".
Researchers added users reported therapy was ""more successful"" when they developed emotional intimacy with their AI therapist.
However, the researchers also raised concerns about the growing phenomenon of synthetic intimacy - where people develop social, emotional or intimate bonds with AI.
University of Sussex Assistant Professor Dr Runyu Shi said: ""Forming an emotional bond with an AI sparks the healing process of self-disclosure.""
She added an ""extraordinary number of people said this worked for them"".
""But we need to look at how AI can be used appropriately and when cases need to be escalated,"" Dr Shi said.
""The app we studied, Wysa, has been specially designed for mental health, but many people are using standard AI and we need to make sure people don't get stuck in a self-fulfilling loop, with dangerous perceptions going unchallenged.""
Researchers said intimacy with AI is generated in a process described as a ""loop"", where users disclose personal information, then have an emotional response.
Users then develop feelings of gratitude, safety and freedom from judgement, according to the report.
Researchers said this could lead to positive changes in thinking and wellbeing, such as self-confidence and higher energy levels.
Over time this loop creates an intimate relationship, with human-like roles attributed to the app, researchers added.
University of Sussex Prof Dimitra Petrakaki said: ""Synthetic intimacy is a fact of modern life now.
""Policymakers and app designers would be wise to accept this reality and consider how to ensure people get help when an AI witnesses users in serious need of clinical intervention.""
Researchers said chatbots were ""increasingly filling the gaps left by overstretched services"".
When asked what safeguarding measures are in place for Wysa's consumer app, Mr Vempati says its risk detection is ""developed by an in-house UK BACP qualified safety team to detect crisis language and signpost users for urgent support"".
""Our AI conversations run within clinician approved and evidence-based protocols using only clinician created interventions to keep users and their data safe,"" he added.
Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, previously told the BBC that chatbots were like an ""inexperienced therapist"", and that humans with decades of experience would be able to engage and ""read"" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.
Another potential problem, said Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots could be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, ""so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you"".

c93w90kqgv9o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w90kqgv9o,technology,Online gaming escaped Australia's social media ban - but critics say it's just as addictive,2025-12-12T20:45:06.715Z,"Wednesday afternoons have become a ritual for 15-year-old Sadmir Perviz. It's a circuitous route from home in Perth to the Fiona Stanley Hospital - but it's worth it, he says, to sit down for a game of Dungeons & Dragons with people he may not know but with whom he shares a great deal in common.
Sadmir and his board game companions are just some of the 300 patients at the gaming disorder clinic, Australia's only publicly-run institution of its type, helping patients wean themselves off excessive online gaming habits.
The room where they meet is a simple space in a faceless hospital but in the corner, there's a pile of boardgames on a chair. Jenga, Uno and Sushi Go are also popular choices at the informal group which is attended by both patients and clinicians.
It's a bit of a departure for the 15-year-old who until a couple of months ago preferred to play games with friends online for 10 hours a day.
""It feels completely different,"" says Sadmir. ""You get to roll the dice instead of clicking a button. You can interact with people, so you actually know who's there rather than just being on a call with random people.""
Dr Daniela Vecchio, the psychiatrist who set up the clinic, says that while gaming isn't bad in itself, it can become a problem - an addiction even.
Gaming platforms and social media pose similar risks for children: excessive time spent online, and potential exposure to predators, harmful content or bullying.
So she wonders why gaming platforms have not been included in Australia's ""world-first"" social media ban for under-16s.
The ban, which came into force on Wednesday, is supposed to prevent teens from having accounts on 10 social media platforms including Instagram, Snapchat and X. Children will still be able to access platforms like YouTube and TikTok, but without accounts.
For Vecchio, the omission of gaming platforms is odd.
""It doesn't make much sense,"" she says.
""Gaming and social media are so interconnected, it's very difficult to separate.
""The individual who plays games for excessive amounts of time also spends excessive amounts of time on social media platforms where they can see other gamers or can live stream gaming, so it's a way to connect.""
Sadmir, for example, spent much of his time on the gaming platform Steam, as well as YouTube. Dr Vecchio singles out the platforms Discord and Roblox as particular worries - a concern echoed by many experts and parents the BBC has spoken to in covering the ban and its impact.
Both Roblox and Discord have been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through them and are facing lawsuits relating to child safety in the US.
Roblox introduced new age assurance features in Australia and two other countries weeks before the social media ban kicked in, with the checks due to be rolled out to the rest of the world in January. The checks will ""help us provide positive, age-appropriate experiences for all users on Roblox"", the company said.
Discord also introduced age checks on some features earlier this year and on Wednesday said it was introducing a new ""teen-by-default"" setting for all Australian users.
Former gaming clinic patient Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether a social media ban could have influenced the access he got at a younger age.
""I was growing up in the wild west of internet usage so, there weren't any restrictions,"" he says. ""I got free rein on the internet basically. So I think that for me, the damage has already been done.""
A former quantum finance intern interested in AI, Mr Koo lost his job just before the pandemic. Living in Sydney, he had no family nearby and no regular work. He says he lost confidence and ended up consumed by online gaming, likening his experience to substance abuse.
Dr Vecchio agrees with the comparison - if she had her way, she'd be tempted not just to expand the social media ban to gaming but to raise the age to 18.
Gaming disorder is also now recognised by the World Health Organisation as an official diagnosis and, according to a 2022 Macquarie University study, around 2.8% of Australian children are affected by it. Vecchio thinks the number at risk is higher.
The Australian government says its ban is about protecting kids from harmful content, cyberbullying, online grooming and ""predatory algorithms"" among other things – some or all of which could arguably be said to exist with gaming platforms.
The Australia Federal Police are among those who have warned chatrooms on these sites are hotbeds for radicalisation and child exploitation.
But, as the eSafety Commissioner said last month, the legislation enforcing the ban means platforms were not selected according to ""safety, a harms or risk-based assessment"".
Instead, platforms have been selected according to three criteria: whether the platform's sole or ""significant purpose"" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post.
Exceptions were made for gaming, for example, because its primary purpose is not social-media style interaction.
The law, say some experts, makes no sense.
""It's incompetence, it's reactionary,"" says Marcus Carter, professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Sydney.
""Social interaction is not a bad thing… There are a bunch of probably legitimate concerns about these big tech platforms and what they are affording children and what they are exposing them to so as a result we've said we are banning social media.
""I just wish the government was trying to figure out how to help rather than put a band-aid on a bullet wound,"" he says.
Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, also says the ban on social media is too blunt a tool – instead a more nuanced approach is needed, including towards gaming platforms.
""There is such a wide spectrum of gaming from incredibly positive, nurturing, fun, creative, expressive spaces - something like Minecraft comes to mind where it's had so many positive uses."" However, platforms like Roblox are at the other end of the spectrum, he says.
""Roblox isn't a game. It's a series of enabling tools for other people to make games. And we know that some of the games that have been made that clearly feel like they're meant for adults have been accessed by very young people.""
On Professor Leaver's desk at the university are three plushies with inbuilt ChatGPT inside them. On the box, it says they are suitable for three and above. This, he says, has also gone too far.
""I do think there needs to be age-appropriate regulation,"" he says, referring to young people going online. ""I do think we're at a moment, and it's not just Australia, you look across the EU, there is huge appetite for all sorts of regulation.""
In Mr Koo's case, for example, his vice wasn't just gaming. It was AI chatbots, another feature of online life that has come under scrutiny for everything from making things up to allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves .
There is evidence they are designed to manipulate users into prolonging interactions and their use has even given rise to a new phenomenon called AI psychosis , in which people increasingly rely on AI chatbots and then become convinced that something imaginary has become real.
Mr Koo also started googling his mental health issues and relying on AI to help confirm his diagnoses.
""You're Googling stuff that you think you already know and then you kind of tick the box after that saying, oh, I've already done my work for today, my therapy work with ChatGPT,"" he says. Mr Koo suffered a psychotic episode and after extensive therapy with a professional, he now takes a different approach.
""I might Google or ChatGPT something and then I'll check it with my therapist in person,"" he says. ""I do think being able to read human emotions and having that face-to-face conversation with someone is completely different.""
The government has said it will continually review the list of banned platforms and at the end of November added Twitch, a streaming platform where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.
Communications Minister Anika Wells also told the BBC last week that the eSafety Commissioner ""definitely has her eye on Roblox"". And, she said, the social media ban ""isn't a cure, it's a treatment plan"" that will ""always evolve"".
The demand for platforms to do better is growing. So too are the queues of families waiting to get help at the gaming disorder clinic, but Vecchio has to turn them away.
""[The legislation] is excluding platforms where children interact with many others and some of them can be people who harm them,"" says Vecchio. ""Children need to be protected, they need to be safeguarded.""

Higher Technical Qualifications (HTQs) are designed to support people in the West Midlands to enter in-demand jobs - including work on AI-enabled health devices such as wearable technology, imaging or diagnostic tools.
The new qualifications are expected to be be taught by colleges, private training providers and universities.
They have been developed in a partnership between West Midlands Combined Authority, Skills England and education firm Pearson, as well as employers.
The Association of British HealthTech Industries estimated an extra 70,000 jobs would be needed by 2035 to meet demand across the sector, alongside 75,000 replacements for those leaving the workforce.
More than 14,000 people work in the sector across the UK, with the West Midlands being home to innovation hubs including Birmingham Health Innovation Campus, Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, West Midlands Health-Tech Accelerator and Arden Cross - a huge development around the HS2 Interchange Station and is a partnership with the University of Warwick.
The new qualifications are being piloted with funding from the West Midlands Investment Zone.
""We've got the UK's largest MedTech cluster, plus even more high-quality jobs coming to Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, so it's essential that we ensure local people can gain the skills they need to work in this sector, and the opportunities to get a foot in the door,"" said West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker.
Phil Smith, chair of Skills England, said MedTech was ""the future"".
""Filling skills gaps for this fast-growing sector, through these new qualifications, will be a really practical way of supporting the NHS through boosting productivity,"" he said.
""It's a fantastic example of how national and regional government can work with employers and the education sector to rapidly respond to skills needs in growth sectors.""

cly33vvrke0o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly33vvrke0o,technology,ScotRail has new AI announcer after 'stolen voice' row,2025-12-12T14:50:10.134Z,"ScotRail has launched a new AI onboard announcer using the voice of an employee following a row over a previous version.
Voiceover artist Gayanne Potter had complained that her voice was used without permission to help train the artificial intelligence announcer Iona.
She claims she was told her work for Swedish technology firm ReadSpeaker would be used for accessibility and e-learning software rather than wider commercial purposes.
Iona has now been replaced by another AI announcer, based on the voice of Paisley-based ScotRail employee Vannessa Sloan.
Ms Potter previously told BBC Scotland News it had been a surprise to hear a ""dreadful"" robotic version of herself.
""It's hard enough for people in the creative industry to sustain careers, but to be competing with a robotic version of yourself adds insult to injury,"" she said.
ReadSpeaker's technology uses AI to learn accents and speech patterns from voice recordings.
The new announcer uses the voice of Ms Sloan, who works in the operator's customer information team. ScotRail said she was already a trusted and familiar presence for passengers.
Phil Campbell, customer operations director, said the new system was ""modern, reliable, and ethically produced"".
""Our people are at the heart of everything we do, so it's fitting that the new voice of ScotRail comes from within our own team,"" he said.
Ms Sloan recorded hundreds of words, sentences, sounds, and stations - many with challenging Scottish pronunciations - across 18 studio sessions.
ScotRail previously told BBC News the tricky place names such as Milngavie and Achnasheen were inputted phonetically as ""Mill-guy"" and ""Akna-sheen"" to help the software avoid embarrassing mistakes.
Ms Sloan was selected after an internal search in which eight staff members recorded sample announcements.
The new voice is already available on Class 380 trains with a wider rollout planned for 2026 that will fully replace the current Iona announcements.
Ms Potter's dispute with ScotRail and ReadSpeaker was raised with First Minister John Swinney in June and was later acknowledged by Transport Scotland.
However, she said there was limited action she could take because the contracted work pre-dated modern voice cloning, and because the firm was based in Sweden.
Jennifer Cass, a partner at law firm Dentons, previously told BBC News there was a gap when it came to protections against AI usage.
She said copyright extended to literary and artistic works but not ""likeness or image"", including voice.
ReadSpeaker said it was aware of Ms Potter's concerns and had ""comprehensively addressed them with her legal representative several times in the past"".
According to ReadSpeaker's website , the Iona voice is still available for commercial sale alongside male-equivalent ""Aidan"".

cp34442z25ko,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34442z25ko,technology,US TikTok investors in limbo as deal set to be delayed again,2025-12-13T00:32:28.133Z,"A billionaire investor keen on buying TikTok's US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms.
The US has repeatedly delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, Bytedance, must sell or be blocked for American users.
US President Donald Trump appears poised to extend the deadline for a fifth time on Tuesday.
""We're just standing by and waiting to see what happens,"" investor Frank McCourt told BBC News.
""But if the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the capital to buy it - we'll see.""
The popular short-form video app was due to be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a law passed by Congress in 2024.
Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, and expressed fears Beijing could force the company to hand over data on US users.
It's a concern TikTok and its owners have always said is unfounded.
The law was signed by President Joe Biden while he was still in office and was upheld by the Supreme Court in early 2025.
Trump and members of his administration have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done , and had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The president has also said ""sophisticated"" US investors would acquire the app , including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies' Michael Dell.
Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal would be formalised in a meeting between Trump and Xi in October - however it concluded without an agreement being reached.
Neither TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, despite Trump's claims.
This time there are no such claims a deal is imminent, leading most analysts to conclude another extension is inevitable.
Without naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned ""about a concentration of power and influence because platforms like TikTok are very influencing"".
He is part of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary.
""My hope would be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, and lands in the hands of people that comply with the law,"" he said.
He said he wants to operate TikTok without any of its Chinese technology, including its powerful recommendation algorithm, and that his Project Liberty has developed other technology that could be used instead.

crmddnge9yro,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmddnge9yro,technology,Trump signs order to block states from enforcing own AI rules,2025-12-12T15:02:57.880Z,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.
""We want to have one central source of approval,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.
It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most ""onerous"" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.
The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.
AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology.
But the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition.
While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House.
This year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.
Those rules range widely.
One in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models.
In North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright.
Oregon brought in a law prohibiting a ""non-human entity"" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse.
Critics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.
""Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,"" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.
California's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order.
""Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,"" he said.
AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice.
""We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,"" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.
Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict.
""It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,"" he said. But, he added: ""That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.""

cwyvkkxxj42o,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyvkkxxj42o,technology,Geminid meteor shower set to light up sky during weekend peak,2025-12-12T07:37:51.182Z,"The Geminid meteor shower - one of the most spectacular in the celestial calendar  - is set to peak this weekend and astronomers say conditions could make for an especially striking show if weather permits.
The meteors are visible all over the world, though people in the Northern Hemisphere will get the best views.
In the UK, if the skies are clear, a waning crescent Moon will only rise after midnight which should mean several hours of dark skies to see the meteors more clearly.
Here's the science behind the Geminids and how to get the best chance of seeing them.
We get treated to meteor showers when Earth passes through the trails of comets - icy objects which Nasa calls 'cosmic snowballs' - or in rarer cases, including the Geminids, asteroids, which are rocky.
When dust and gases from these objects enter our atmosphere, they burn up and create the bright streaks we know as shooting stars.
While most meteors appear white, some can glow green, yellow, red, or blue, depending on the elements in the material as it burns up in Earth's atmosphere.
Metals such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium produce colours similar to those seen in fireworks.
The Geminids shower comes from the remnants of an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon.
Until recently, scientists thought the Geminids were a result of dust escaping from 3200 Phaethon. But two years ago scientists revealed that Phaethon's tail is actually made of glowing sodium gas. So there is still some uncertainty about how and when the Geminids dust was formed.
The Geminids offer one of the year's best chances, weather-permitting, of seeing a shower, due to the volume and frequency of its 'shooting stars'.
""What you'd be looking at in a nice dark sky without clouds would be, say, 100 an hour, which is amazing, said Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society.
""It's pretty much the strongest meteor shower of the year.""
Bright moonlight can make it more difficult to see meteors and other objects in the night sky. But weather-permitting, we could have close to ideal viewing conditions as the Geminids peak.
The crescent Moon is in its final waning phases, with the bulk of it in shadow, and in the UK it also won't rise until the early hours of the morning, potentially giving us a nice dark sky in which to watch the spectacle.
Do keep in mind that visibility is still heavily influenced by weather conditions, so check your local forecast for the clearest possible window.
Finding somewhere without light pollution and with an open view of the sky will give you the best chance of seeing something.
The Geminids are a naked-eye event, best enjoyed under dark, open skies, so you won't need a telescope or binoculars.
""There aren't that many entirely free natural treats. And this is one of them. So go out and enjoy it. You know, it's a way of connecting with the sky, taking a moment to sort of forget our more earthly or more worldly concerns,"" said Dr Massey.
The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation of Gemini, but looking slightly away from that point often provides a wider field of view.
Dress warmly and take a blanket or reclining chair to get comfortable, and let your eyesight adapt to the dark.
""You just basically need to have reasonable eyesight to see this and I think that is incredible.""
The Geminids meteor shower peaks on Sunday 14 December.
Unfortunately, the weather in the UK isn't looking ideal for viewing. Both Saturday and Sunday are expected to be windy and cloudy, with outbreaks of rain during the day and night.
On Sunday night, there may be a few drier, clearer spells. Northern Scotland and the Northern Isles, as well as parts of East Anglia and southeast England, are likely to have the best chances of catching a glimpse of the night sky.
But keep on checking in as there may be gaps in the gloom. A good place to keep track of the potential for a good viewing in your area is The Met Office's UK Cloud Cover Map and via BBC Weather .
